[{"content":" Office Shelves Book cases, book shelves, whatever you call them, I am drawn towards them. It is always interesting to see what people put on theirs. Both the books and also the trinkets or sundries. It\u0026rsquo;s such a big collection of stories, both contained within the book but of the person that owns them. What is the journey that this book has come along to get to this shelf? What did the reader think when they got the book, when (if) they read it? Where is the book going next?\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re lucky you have space, and shelves and books to together, and then you get to choose what goes on them, and where in the house these books should live. You get to pick the order in which they\u0026rsquo;re stacked on the shelf.\nOr maybe these decisions have never been made, and just the natural flow of life has resulted in books on shelves with the same choosing that results in driftwood on a beach.\nKids books on the landing Some books have obvious places to live. Kids books in or near kids rooms for bedtime stories, or for them to hide away from the world and enjoy the quiet company of a book.\nRecipe books in the kitchen. Some carefully written down instructions past down through the family, some old favourites of chefs long retired, some modern and cool but totally impractical for busy family life.\nKitchen bookshelf I always enjoy looking at other people\u0026rsquo;s bookcases, as a whole and at individual books. Always a good topic of conversation.\nBedroom bookshelf I have a lot of ebooks too. These are very convenient to take with me on holiday and great for reading at night in bed. I can read for hours in the dark with my backlit ebook reader and no-one else is disturbed. But no-one else will really read those books unless I actively tell them or they come asking. These books are hidden away, never to provide entertainment for a curious passerby.\nBoys\u0026rsquo; bookshelf I suppose the next best thing to admiring books, is to actually read them. Maybe even write some thoughts down as you read them.\nDaughter\u0026rsquo;s bookshelf What\u0026rsquo;s on your bookcase? 📚\n","date":"3 March 2023","permalink":"/posts/2023/bookcases/","section":"Posts","summary":"A joy to behold","title":"Bookcases"},{"content":"","date":"3 March 2023","permalink":"/tags/books/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Books"},{"content":"","date":"3 March 2023","permalink":"/tags/home/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Home"},{"content":"","date":"3 March 2023","permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":"3 March 2023","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"Hi! 👋\n","date":"3 March 2023","permalink":"/","section":"Welcome to my site","summary":"Hi! 👋","title":"Welcome to my site"},{"content":"","date":"27 January 2023","permalink":"/tags/film/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Film"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to write this up for the last 14 months! I also took a lot more photos for this post but I don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be able to find any\u0026hellip;🤷\nA while back, in 2021, I was making a wiki note on large format cameras, specifically 4x5 cameras. Jack noticed this and asked me if I would be interested in his B\u0026amp;J Press camera. Very generous of him! Postage to the UK wasn\u0026rsquo;t the cheapest, but it was still far cheaper than trying to find anything here.\nBurke and James Press Camera This is a 4x5 camera, meaning it takes 4x5\u0026quot; film. It just uses one sheet at a time and it is a VERY manual process! With so many steps from what you see to a photo, that if you get it right the sense of accomplishment is beyond words.\nIt took me a few months before I mustered up everything I needed, plus the commitment to actually use it. I got a box of Fomapan 400 sheets, loaded them into the film backs in my dark bag and proceeded to try and take a picture of something.\nMake shift dark cloth I took it into the back garden and took some (two) photos of the house and then of the kids. Amazingly they stood still long enough for me to faff about and take the shot.\nUp to this point, whilst I had been taking film photos, I\u0026rsquo;d never developed anything myself and had just been sending off the film to labs. Now with 4x5 this is a lot harder as it\u0026rsquo;s great big sheets that you can\u0026rsquo;t expose to the light. I\u0026rsquo;d have to post off the whole holder, and that did not seem very reliable, plus the cost was tremendous. So as well as doing my first 4x5, I was also doing my first home development\u0026hellip;in trays!\nI set it all up in the bathroom in the spare room, it has no windows and I thought it would be a good location. All the trays were filled and I was ready to develop. It\u0026rsquo;s quite strange (and very uncomfortable) sitting on the floor for 20 minutes whilst trying to develop these sheets. I also realised that, after adjusting the the darkness for 20 minutes, that the room wasn\u0026rsquo;t as dark as I thought it was. Oh well.\nBy some miracle of beginners luck I did manage to make a photo!\nThat vintage look Technically, it is absolutely terrible, and look at all those scratches and uneven developing marks. However, I love it.\nUnfortunately, it would end up being the only successful photo I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to make with the B\u0026amp;J. I tried it again and everything was black. Somewhere, something is leaking light and I\u0026rsquo;d need to do a lot of investigating to figure out exactly what is the problem. Is the film I bought sealed from the light? Is it the film holder? Is it the camera? Did I develop it correctly? And maybe some others. I did buy a special developing tank for the 4x5 to make it less painful to develop.\nSo for the past 14 months, the B\u0026amp;J has made a nice shelf decoration with my camera things. I enjoyed using it, and I\u0026rsquo;d like to do it again, but maybe when I have more time. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely one for the retired/kids have left home timeframe!\n","date":"27 January 2023","permalink":"/posts/2023/first-attempts-at-4x5/","section":"Posts","summary":"Taking snapshots like it\u0026rsquo;s 1924","title":"First attempts with 4x5"},{"content":"","date":"27 January 2023","permalink":"/tags/photography/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Photography"},{"content":"\r","date":"1 January 2023","permalink":"/notes/qso/","section":"Notes","summary":"QRZ Logbook","title":"QSO"},{"content":"","date":"27 December 2022","permalink":"/tags/games/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Games"},{"content":"Annual recaps seem to be the trend in social media and apps. It\u0026rsquo;s quite interesting actually. Reddit did one, which told me the scary number of hours I\u0026rsquo;ve spent on the app. Including spending 25 hours on /r/leica 🤫\nSteam now do one and shows me how much time I spend on games. I knew I didn\u0026rsquo;t play that much but I was surprised by how little I did actually play!\nDoesn\u0026rsquo;t actually compute time I played Black Mesa, the Half-Life 1 remake in the HL2 engine, in March this year for just shy of 20 hours. My friend and I played Grim Dawn, think Diablo 2, in August and September for about 15 hours. We also played Streets of Rage 4, a remake of the Sega classics from the 90s. This was a disappointingly short game at 3.6 hours. It was fun but I\u0026rsquo;m sure the originals were much longer. That, or we just used to play them endlessly as penniless kids.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve tried to play Horizon Zero Dawn a couple of times. Not sure why I\u0026rsquo;ve not got into it properly. It\u0026rsquo;s a nice RPG story game, but seems to have a unique storyline which looks interesting. It\u0026rsquo;s quite old now, and so often goes on sale. I picked it up at the start of the year but didn\u0026rsquo;t properly play it until June (if you count 3 hours as properly). I think that was a bit before our summer holidays and so when I came back I\u0026rsquo;d forgotten the controls and what was happening so didn\u0026rsquo;t continue. Then the longer I left it the harder it was to restart. I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about it recently but yet to start.\nNot much since March I actually want to play more games in 2023. I enjoy playing them and it\u0026rsquo;s a good way to relax if I\u0026rsquo;m tired from work. Feels like a better use of time than randomly browsing the internet, or spending another 25 hours on certain subreddits!\nTo finish the year, I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing Dwarf Fortress. I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing this game for years\u0026hellip;I don\u0026rsquo;t remember exactly when I found it, but I think around 2011. It\u0026rsquo;s been free forever on their website, but they just released a version on Steam this month. It has a new UI and a little bit more approachable. I\u0026rsquo;ve you\u0026rsquo;ve not heard of it then you\u0026rsquo;re missing out on some internet game lore. It\u0026rsquo;s a game made by two brothers that they started in 2002. They have been making this game as their full time job since then (or maybe about 2006) and living off donations. It is a simulation game and is detailed beyond anything ever. At the same time the original graphics are just ASCII characters. Wikipedia can do a better job of explaining it than me.\nI bought the Steam version, partly to support them and partly because it has a new UI. With christmas and everything I\u0026rsquo;ve not played much, about 8 hours, but it\u0026rsquo;s one I plan to continue into the new year.\n","date":"27 December 2022","permalink":"/posts/2022/my-steam-replay/","section":"Posts","summary":"I never play any games","title":"My 2022 Steam Replay"},{"content":" I already sold the 50\u0026hellip; This post sat as a draft for a long time when I was using blot. Whilst migrating my site to this new Hugo one I saw the pictures I took and thought I might as well write it up quickly.\nSide by side Background # I ended up with both the 50mm f/2 and the 60mm f/2.4. The first as I wanted a longer lens for when out and about, but still light and quick focusing, and the latter as I started scanning my film with my camera. One day I decided that having both was unnecessary and I went about deciding which one to get rid of.\nComparison # What a big hood you have They\u0026rsquo;re both similar in size and weight, except when you put the massive metal hood on the 60 mm, which adds another 70g, 30% weight of the lens itself! The 60mm must flare badly if it has such a stonking great hood. Does mean you don\u0026rsquo;t always need to carry it with you.\nLightweight 50mm That hood Being 60mm, you do get more subject separation than the 50mm, even with the fraction slower speed. So for portraits - where people are standing still - the 60mm is probably better. It\u0026rsquo;s also of the old, original set of Fuji lenses (along with the 35mm f/1.4 and the 56 f/1.2), which means it has a slightly different look than the modern ones. Good or bad? That\u0026rsquo;s personal preference. I certainly like the 35mm one.\nf/2.4 vs f/2 is not really much different, although I\u0026rsquo;ve not done sharpness tests etc., for that you\u0026rsquo;ll have to look elsewhere.\nThe obvious difference is that the 60mm has close focus for macro - this was the very reason I bought it. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure 60mm is a great macro length and it\u0026rsquo;s not a perfect 1:1 macro, so YMMV. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about replacing mine as for film scanning I can\u0026rsquo;t make use of the full sensor area with this lens, so seems like a waste.\nSpeaking of focusing\u0026hellip;oh my, how the 60mm is slow compared to the 50mm. It\u0026rsquo;s not super slow, and perfectly usable even for kids running around but it\u0026rsquo;s not the 🫰 and you\u0026rsquo;re there focus of the 50mm. Having said that, the 50mm often missed focus on kids running around so not perfect either.\nConclusion # As I already said, I sold the 50mm and kept the 60mm. I need the macro (unless I change my mind on the camera scanning solution) and I don\u0026rsquo;t often like shooting at longer lengths and I rarely/never do portrait sessions, so the 50mm doesn\u0026rsquo;t make much sense. Plus if I did do portraits, I could use the 60mm and it would be fine.\nI actually have the 60mm for sale, with the intent to replace it with a better macro. There are various 3rd party manual focus macros which are much better and would be ideal for film scanning. Although I\u0026rsquo;m also tempted to abandon film scanning with my camera and just buy a dedicated 35mm scanner like the Plusteks. I used to own one but sold it and now I regret that. Whilst they\u0026rsquo;re slow to scan, everything is right there and easy to do. If the 60mm ever sells then I\u0026rsquo;ll decide what I\u0026rsquo;ll do.\n","date":"18 December 2022","permalink":"/posts/2022/fuji-50-or-60/","section":"Posts","summary":"Which is better?","title":"Choosing between the Fuji 50mm f/2 and the 60mm f/2.4"},{"content":"","date":"18 December 2022","permalink":"/tags/fuji/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Fuji"},{"content":"","date":"18 December 2022","permalink":"/tags/gear/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Gear"},{"content":" If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.\nBooks I\u0026rsquo;ve read # 2023 # Ship of Magic, (1998), Robin Hobb, 880 pp The Price Of Money: How to prosper in a financial world that’s rigged against you, (2023), Rob Dix, 182 pp Assassin\u0026rsquo;s Quest, (1997), Robin Hobb, 757 pp Royal Assassin, (1996), Robin Hobb, 675 pp Assassin\u0026rsquo;s Apprentice, (1995), Robin Hobb, 435 pp 2022 # Return of the King, (1955), J.

Whilst I was very excited that it worked, the next thing was actually seeing the images. I did take a tiny picture of several frames using my phone and the filmdev app. That was fun just to see that there was something.\nQuick scan with phone The next thing is making larger images. My two choices were scanning onto the computer or dark room printing. Unfortunately, I don\u0026rsquo;t have a darkroom (although I do want to somehow make one in the garage), so scanning it is. When I scanned my grandfather\u0026rsquo;s slides I used a dedicated 35mm/slide scanner. The Plustek 8200 or something, together with Silverfast AI. The scanner is slow, the software is very weird, but once you figured out the routine you could steadily work your way through them all. In my wisdom, I\u0026rsquo;d sold the Plustek after finishing the slides - actually made money on it, which when I then came to look at buying another realised that this is because the prices are going up, and still going up, for used models. Another option is a flatbed scanner, but those are quite expensive and sounded more annoying for 35mm.\nThe final option is using a digital camera. As I have a digital camera, this did seem the more sensible option. However, you do need quite a few other things to make it all work. Namely a tripod or stand, light source, macro lens, and something to hold the film/black out around it. Like all things you can spend a fortune on any one of these items. I tried not to but the macro lens was never going to be cheap. I went for the Fuji 60mm f/2.4 as I thought it would also be useful as a mid-range portrait lens. I\u0026rsquo;ve never used it for that but I still might. However, having used it for scanning I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I like it for that. I\u0026rsquo;ve found manual focus is more reliable and helps speed up the process once it\u0026rsquo;s dialled in and the 60mm\u0026rsquo;s focus by wire isn\u0026rsquo;t that great. Perhaps I\u0026rsquo;ll look to sell it and get a manual focus one - assuming it\u0026rsquo;s a net cost to me.\nFirst attempts with a terrible tripod Back when I did my first development on 4x5, I tried a cheapo camera stand thing and a home made, black card mask. The mask was actually fine but the tripod stand thing was absolutely terrible. Wobbly and hard to adjust. It went straight back and I shelled out for a reasonable tripod. I had to find one that let me rotate the pole around so the camera can be mounted underneath. This is much more stable, secure and makes it easy to keep things parallel. For 35mm I think a home made mask might get tedious, so I went with an essential film holder. This gets lots of great reviews online, and as far as holders go it\u0026rsquo;s a cheap one - although still £75\u0026hellip;\nA much nicer tripod and film holder The fold out screen of the X-E4 is very handy for lining stuff up and changing settings. It flips the display when the screen moves past a certain angle which is ideal, it does mean the menu navigation is backwards but I can get used to that. I should make a preset for scanning so that I can get going quicker next time, as changing settings is a bit of a hassle as I then have to change them back later. I think I\u0026rsquo;ve messed up one of my presets so I\u0026rsquo;ll have to check that next time I\u0026rsquo;m using the camera. The macro lens isn\u0026rsquo;t quite long enough to get the film to completely fill the screen/sensor, extension tubes could fix that, or a longer lens. Maybe 80mm or 100mm? It\u0026rsquo;s not too big a deal as I just crop in post, which I\u0026rsquo;d do anyway. It also makes it quick to align as I\u0026rsquo;m not trying to hit it perfect straight away. Probably means my images are 12-14 megapixel vs. the cameras 26. Still plenty big enough.\nCamera close up I spent a lot of time faffing about with trying to do tethered photos with Lightroom on the computer. Eventually realised that my copy of lightroom needs a paid for add-on to do it with Fuji. I then tried Fuji\u0026rsquo;s X Acquire but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get it to work. The instructions said to put the camera in a certain mode, but my settings didn\u0026rsquo;t have that option, only for a webcam, so I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I also tried using the remote app on my phone but it was too slow and awkward for focusing. I was concerned about camera shake, but I just ended up using the 2 second delay to take the photos. This worked well, except it makes a really loud beeping sound which annoyed my wife in the other room whilst she was watching TV!\nJust to add to it all, my battery was very low and all the fiddling around I\u0026rsquo;d been doing meant it died after a few shots.\nThe starting point Once I got the first image in focus with peaking and zooming it, I could quite quickly move between frames and capture the whole roll in not much time at all. I think with a scanning preset setup on the camera, next time should be very quick.\nI then spent ages fighting with Lightroom again until I realised my copy, again, was too old and didn\u0026rsquo;t support my camera\u0026rsquo;s raw files. So that was the end of Lightroom. When I went to bed that night I realised I could use another program to convert the RAFs to DNGs and use Lightroom.\nI have a copy of Capture One Express for Fujifilm, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d try that out, as all the negatives are, well, negative, I need to invert them and crop them at a minimum before I have useable images. C1ex seems a little buggy as it would crash when I\u0026rsquo;d try and customise the menu bars but I soon found my groove with it. Probably all photo editors can do it, but copying and pasting settings, and everything having a keyboard shortcut made editing (once I got the hang of it), very quick. I probably spent 20 minutes on the first two images, and then 10 on the other 26. (I seem to only have 28 from my 36 roll 😕)\nFlip the curve There are loads of film conversion tools out there and it\u0026rsquo;s overwhelming. Either as standalone things or plugins to various programs - typically Lightroom, or Photoshop. Negative Lab Pro seems to be the most common/popular one, it\u0026rsquo;s for LrC, but given all my heartache with Lightroom, I\u0026rsquo;ve not tried it yet. I think these plugins are probably most useful for colour negatives. Black and white is fairly easy. The common method of \u0026ldquo;flipping the curve\u0026rdquo;, i.e. move the ends of the line to the opposite of where they start, does the job. I then cropped out the blank area, and film edges, hit auto, tweaked a few things like exposure and blacks/whites and the image is good to go! Then paste the settings to the rest and crop them.\nThe final output I later found moving saturation all the way to zero ensured my images were black and white and didn\u0026rsquo;t have some blue tinge from the white balance setting. Usually auto was fine, but sometimes I had to use the white balance picker to find a suitable white part to get it right. I did scan all the images upside down, so next time I can fix that.\nI\u0026rsquo;m pleased with the results, and it\u0026rsquo;s nice to have done the whole thing from exposing the photo, developing the film to scanning and processing it myself. Now that I\u0026rsquo;ve done it once, and know what I\u0026rsquo;m doing, and together with some pre-configuration of camera and setup, I think the next roll will be pretty quick to do. As long as I\u0026rsquo;ve charged the battery first!\n","date":"26 October 2022","permalink":"/posts/2022/film-scanning-with-camera/","section":"Posts","summary":"First attempts at scanning with digital","title":"Film scanning with my digital camera"},{"content":"My dad likes photography, but he doesn\u0026rsquo;t really have a camera. He used to own one, think it was a Praktica SLR. He\u0026rsquo;s told me the story of dropping it in the sand at a beach and also of setting up a darkroom space in his bathroom, but then never getting a chance to use it before moving. Having said he likes photography, I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure how many photos he\u0026rsquo;s taken. Not the exact number, but whether it\u0026rsquo;s been a consistent thing over time. He gave the SLR to my sister - not that I think she\u0026rsquo;s used it - and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if he has any digital camera other than his phone.\nThis is the issue though, would he want something beyond his phone? He also doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a computer, just an iPad, and I feel like photography on an iPad, whilst doable, is not that enjoyable, particularly if you\u0026rsquo;re not up for \u0026ldquo;a routine\u0026rdquo; to make it all work.\nSo why am I looking for a camera for my dad? Mostly because I think he\u0026rsquo;d like it. He likes birds and gets a lot of wildlife in his garden. He also lives in the countryside with lots of good walks. There\u0026rsquo;s lots of scope for wildlife and landscapes, although I feel like he\u0026rsquo;d want to focus on birds.\nThe most obvious choice is a digital with super zoom. Maybe APS-C to get some reach, or even MFT as I see a lot of bird photos with them on reddit. I don\u0026rsquo;t really want to spend a huge amount - I had thought about asking my sisters if they want to split it with me for his Christmas, but that probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t add that much. This then leads to used cameras, and maybe something like a Nikon D90, and a Tameron lens. However, something exactly like a D90 ends up being a lot more expensive than you think. I think as it\u0026rsquo;s well known and then it\u0026rsquo;s quite popular and that keeps the price high.\nWhilst I don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend too much money, I also don\u0026rsquo;t want it to be a terrible camera and then be annoying to use.\nI\u0026rsquo;m partially tempted to get a film SLR and a long lens, mostly as it\u0026rsquo;s quite straight forward to use, the film gets developed and then there\u0026rsquo;s no digital media to deal with. Not that he couldn\u0026rsquo;t deal with it but it would simplify stuff. However, maybe I\u0026rsquo;m just projecting my enjoyment of film on to others\u0026hellip;\nThis wasn\u0026rsquo;t a very in-depth assessment at possible options, and writing it mostly made me wonder if he really would actually like a camera or not. I\u0026rsquo;m leaning towards no and so, whilst I do enjoy a good research project, it seems like a waste of time. He\u0026rsquo;s had cameras, they have digital cameras in the house that belong to my sisters that he could\u0026rsquo;ve easily borrowed. Maybe getting one as a present would change his mindset, but I feel like he is too busy to start another hobby.\nPerhaps the real outcome is asking him about it.\n","date":"17 October 2022","permalink":"/posts/2022/finding-a-camera-for-my-dad/","section":"Posts","summary":"Discussing options for a camera for my dad","title":"Finding a camera for my dad"},{"content":" Smile 😅 This, the 35mm f/1.4, just arrived today from eBay. I fitted it to my X-E4 and took a selfie in front of the mirror. It\u0026rsquo;s night time so it\u0026rsquo;s dark and I decided just to focus on the camera not my tired eyes. I can\u0026rsquo;t believe how light this lens is, even with the hood on. It\u0026rsquo;s lighter than my 50mm f/2. It\u0026rsquo;s quite long, particularly with the hood but because of its lightness it balances nicely on the X-E4. Aesthetically, the 18mm looks better on the X-E4 - like a mini-Q2!\nQuite a deep lens, particularly with hood I\u0026rsquo;m listing my 50 f/2 this weekend, and so I\u0026rsquo;ve justified this new lens to myself as it\u0026rsquo;ll be a swap. The 50mm is nice but a little boring and whilst I try and take it out with me, I find it\u0026rsquo;s a little too long most of the time. The 35mm, or 50mm eq., is a much more useful focal length for me. Perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s a little excessive as now I have the 18, 23, 27, and 35 primes, and they\u0026rsquo;re all so close to each other. I still think they all have a specific purpose, driven by their physical size, aperture and focal length, so I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;d sell any of them just yet.\n35mm on APS-C used to be my go to length for years. I had a Nikon 35mm f/1.8 for my D40/7000/7200. It was perfect and I enjoyed using it a lot. When I moved to Fuji and the X100F I was at 23mm. As that was my only camera, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a choice but I have come to like 23mm (or 35mm eq.) focal length. When I moved to the X-T2, the 23mm f/1.4 was my second prime, right after the 35mm f/2. The first lens I bought for my M2 was the 35mm. I do have a 90mm for it but again, like the Fuji 50, it\u0026rsquo;s a little too long for every day usage.\nBack to the Fuji, and even with the extra weight and size the 23mm was my go to lens. I later sold the 35mm f/2 as I found I didn\u0026rsquo;t use it. When I was first looking for a lens for my X-T2, I did consider the 35mm f/1.4 for a long time. I ended up not picking it as everyone said it was slow autofocusing and it was more expensive. It is the older style, original lenses from Fujifilm and it does have a slower and noisier autofocus, but it\u0026rsquo;s not that slow.\nLong nosed Q The internet talks a lot about this lens, and how it has special qualities and a unique look. I don\u0026rsquo;t know about that, but portraits at 1.4 do have a little edge over f/2. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to capturing everyone with it and seeing if I can see that special look. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably never see it, but if I make pleasing images with it then that\u0026rsquo;ll do me.\nPlus when I get bored of it, and realise I have too many primes within 5mm of each other, I can just sell it and probably not lose much if anything.\n","date":"5 October 2022","permalink":"/posts/2022/new-fuji-lens/","section":"Posts","summary":"Welcoming yet another lens to my collection","title":"A new Fujifilm lens"},{"content":"","date":"1 October 2022","permalink":"/tags/hardware/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hardware"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m referring to used prebuilt computers, and not laptops\u0026hellip;all of those are prebuilt. Things like HP or Dell or Lenovo desktop or server machines. I do quite like them. They offer good performance at a good price, and generally there are loads of them available. They\u0026rsquo;re typically ex-business machines and have enjoyed a comfy life in an office. They usually have good CPUs and if you\u0026rsquo;re lucky you can get decent ram and SSDs in them already. Being for businesses they tend to have great accessibility to the insides, often being designed nicely to access bays or replace parts. They often have nice hard drive bays, perfectly sized cables tucked in just right, and they often have specific power supplies that are compact, and efficient. Some of them only make 12V which makes them really efficient. Cooling is usually well thought out, and with nice ducting and rubber grommeted fans to keep vibrations low.\nCompact SSF form factor I\u0026rsquo;d say if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a general purpose machine, either desktop or server, you can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong with some line of these machines. There are a lot of models and series over the years. Price reflects this but with some research, or just filtering by CPU you can find what you need. Modern CPUs are ridiculously powerful and will be fine for many years.\nIf you go for recent models, like 10th gen intel, then the power draw by these machines is tiny on idle, but then you still get a 8 or more threaded CPU when you do hit the gas. These machines often come in multiple sizes, from tiny chassis up to basically full size towers. Space and expansion obviously aligns with the size, but if you just need laptop innards but in a desktop then the tiny models are great. If size is a concern then the tiny or not-quite-so-tiny desktop models may be a great selling point for you. Like a NUC but without the premium price tag to go with it.\nWell organised inside So why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you buy one? Generally these are designed for businesses and as such graphics performance tends to be poor for gaming or ML /GPU intensive work. That\u0026rsquo;s not to say you can\u0026rsquo;t get models with GPUs or larger cases have space for them, but then the power supply tends not to be sufficient. Expansion of these machines tends to be quite limited. This is of course dependant on your perspective. As you can still get 64GB of ram and 1-3 storage devices (NVME, SSD, HDD), and a PCI-E expansion card (depending on the model). So be sure to know what you want before you buy it, as it\u0026rsquo;s not as flexible as a regular desktop. Little things like using special power supply connectors on the motherboard means you can\u0026rsquo;t put in a new PSU to enable running a bigger GPU, or some SATA slots are weirdly slow as they\u0026rsquo;re only meant for DVD drives. There aren\u0026rsquo;t extra SATA power cables for another drive, even if you could stick it somewhere. The motherboard is a weird shape or size, so you would struggle to move it into a regular case - because you wanted to expand it.\nProprietary PSU - efficient but let\u0026rsquo;s hope it doesn\u0026rsquo;t fail If something fails then it might mean the whole computer is done. If you\u0026rsquo;re lucky there are parts on ebay or somewhere. This is probably just the motherboard and PSU, with PSU being the most annoying if it failed.\nMy experience # I\u0026rsquo;ve owned 3-4 of these over the years and they\u0026rsquo;ve all been great. Again, that price vs. performance is hard to beat. You get everything for the same price as maybe buying a motherboard and CPU - even used parts. I think the older ones were generally more compatible, and the newer ones have more proprietary connections and designs. However, if you research them carefully (they all have maintenance manuals online) and get what you need, I see no reason not to get one.\nEasy access design My latest one is a HP ProDesk 400 G7. It has a 10th gen intel i5, and came with an 8GB stick and a 256GB NVME. It\u0026rsquo;s the small form factor (SFF) so has a 1x and 16x PCI-e slot, and has space for 2x 2.5\u0026quot; drives, or 1x 3.5\u0026quot;. Currently it has a DVD (maybe writer) in the slot. I wanted a new server that was lower powered when on idle, and a newer intel CPU to take advantage of the Quicksync transcoding feature for plex. There are multiple G series, one for each intel gen. The price for the G7 seemed worth it to me. According to the manual it should idle at about 5W (pre-any drives I assume),\nThis is replacing a previous prebuilt of the Lenovo TS-140. I actually bought that new as there was a really good cashback offer on it, which made it a fraction of the price. Maybe even $150 or something. This came with a 4th gen i3 but I upgraded it to a Xeon 1246 v3. It has served me well, and is still perfectly fine, however, it idles at 50W and can\u0026rsquo;t do h265 natively. It does, however, have space for 4x 3.5\u0026quot; drives (with a bit of an adapter in the 5.25\u0026quot; bays).\nI currently have 4x 4TB WD Red drives in a ZFS RAIDZ1 array, so usable storage of about 12 TB. I don\u0026rsquo;t need 12 TB, although I have used a lot. We\u0026rsquo;ve tried to tidy up but there are a lot of old movies that we had on DVD or even VHS that we\u0026rsquo;ve kept. Many don\u0026rsquo;t get watched but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to part with them. So perhaps I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have got a machine that can only house one drive\u0026hellip;.\nBuying used has some risk 🧹 Right now I\u0026rsquo;m thinking that I could just get one drive for the new server and have everything on that. I\u0026rsquo;ll keep my existing drives, either in the current computer or maybe look for a cheap 4 bay housing thing (tbh the current computer is probably the most sensible option other than it takes up more space) and use it as a pure NAS that turns on ~once a week for backups.\nWith the price of power going through the roof, I\u0026rsquo;ve been driven by power consumption. It does come with trade offs but I tend to find that I can easily live within constraints when they occur, and is in fact a better approach than designing for all eventualities. Although I\u0026rsquo;m still guilty of fixing things that aren\u0026rsquo;t broke!\n","date":"1 October 2022","permalink":"/posts/2022/prebuilt-trade-offs/","section":"Posts","summary":"Discussing the pros and cons of buying a prebuilt vs. making you own","title":"The trade offs of a prebuilt"},{"content":"After the previous attempt, where I concluded the developer had expired, I was determined to continue. First I had to purchase some new developer. I decided to go for Kodak HC-110. This appears to be a classic developer from the beginning of time and it\u0026rsquo;s high dilution ratio and long shelf life attracted me to it. Initially, I thought it was more expensive than the Ilford ilfosol 3, but that\u0026rsquo;s because I didn\u0026rsquo;t notice I was buying 1 litre of HC-110 vs. the 500 ml of ilfosol (the pictures are the same size on the website 😅), and even with that obvious difference the dilution means the HC-110 wins out. I also took the opportunity to get some photoflo - this helps avoid water marks. Hydrophobic solution or some such. I found water marks and drying a pain when doing 4x5. The 35mm is a lot smaller but one less thing to deal with is always nice. The HC-110 does have a lot of warning labels on it, much more so than the Ilford. Perhaps that\u0026rsquo;s just for the US market or perhaps it really is much worse for the environment? The whole development process does seem to be not great for the environment, I feel like I use a lot of water. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there\u0026rsquo;s ways to improve this and I\u0026rsquo;ll look into it more.\nNew chemicals Last time I had to figure out how to open the canister without a fancy tool, and so this time I got straight in and ripped it open like a hungry bear opening a dumpster lid. However, this time it took me forever to get the film onto the plastic development spool. Literally 45 minutes. I was tucked into my dark bag, absolutely sweating, fiddling about trying to get it on and to take. Once it did go but then seem to get stuck half way and wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go any further. I had to then unwind it and start all over again 😢. My wife was out and I daren\u0026rsquo;t take my arms out of the dark bag whilst the film was completely exposed inside, and I was wishing I\u0026rsquo;d setup my iPad or phone next to me so I could try and get Siri to start playing a video of loading a spool. But then somehow it just worked. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t perfect, the last little bit didn\u0026rsquo;t quite seem to go on, and so I tucked it in myself. Phew\u0026hellip;all loaded, and now I could start the actual development! Seems like not perfectly dry plastic spools can have this issue. Although does make me interested in stuff like this. Video explainer.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve made a permanent place now to write my instructions so I won\u0026rsquo;t forget, but doing it in practice is quite different from reading about it. I used a tiny measuring cylinder for the HC-110, but then rinsing the developer into the larger measuring cylinder was a bit of a hassle, I might use a syringe next time. I\u0026rsquo;d made up all the stocks. I am using a stop chemical - people tell me they just use water, and probably I will in the future - but as I have it and it\u0026rsquo;s getting a bit old I might as well use it up. I\u0026rsquo;d bought some new fixer as well. The Ilford one I have as expired according to the label and so I didn\u0026rsquo;t want something else ruining it. The Adox one gives you a choice of dilution and seemingly it just means you wait longer\u0026hellip;so why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t I go for the more dilute one?\nThe stop and the developer are both this pale yellow colour when made up, and I\u0026rsquo;d placed them in the order I\u0026rsquo;d use them on the side of the sink. I\u0026rsquo;d also put a thermometer into the developer to stir it and see what the temperature was - seems our utility is a bit colder than the rest of the house and was only at 18 °C. However, what I hadn\u0026rsquo;t noticed was that my labelled measuring cylinders were the wrong way round - I have one I\u0026rsquo;ve written \u0026lsquo;dev\u0026rsquo; on and one with \u0026lsquo;stop\u0026rsquo; on (also one with \u0026lsquo;fix\u0026rsquo;). I\u0026rsquo;d made up the solution into the wrong one! Not a super big deal but after I\u0026rsquo;d poured in the developer I noticed and then that got me doubting I knew exactly which was which! If I was really worried, I could\u0026rsquo;ve poured it out, washed a lot and then started again. However, I was fairly confident because of the thermometer\u0026hellip;\nTime past, agitation was applied, and then the gallons of water was washed over the film. I dipped the spool in the photoflo (that\u0026rsquo;ll last ages as 200:1 dilution! aka a drop), and then lifted it out to see what happened\u0026hellip;\nSuccess! I was overjoyed to see the development had worked. No blank or black or something film, just lovely little 35mm frames all the way along. In my excitement I wasn\u0026rsquo;t paying attention to how I was cutting them up, and instead of strips of 6 it was all over the place with 4, 6, 8\u0026hellip;all sorts! The photoflo seemed to work well as the water just ran right off them whilst hanging up to dry.\nDrying nicely So that was yesterday, and by the time it was all done, it was time for bed! Now the next mammoth effort, which is scanning them in. I think I have everything I need, although still deciding upon what software to use. Everyone seems to love negative lab pro, and I\u0026rsquo;ve downloaded the free trial to test it out. It\u0026rsquo;s just that it\u0026rsquo;s another $100 on something. All this stuff\u0026hellip;there are lots of free things, or just instructions for Lightroom, and the open source editors like GIMP or Darktable all do it to some degree. What I would really like to do is make a contact sheet, just so I can look at them quickly and see what\u0026rsquo;s what. I had a quick mess about with the Film Dev app on iOS and laying a couple of strips on my light box. That actually works out pretty well just to see what you have. I could do with a holder or a transparent storage sleeve to hold them in. Annoyingly I just bought some 35mm storage sleeves two days ago, but I\u0026rsquo;d just gone for ones with opaque tracing paper style back, mostly as that\u0026rsquo;s what came up first and I have them already from films done by the lab. Now I see there are just as many transparent ones, which are probably more useful to have in the long run for going back through all photos. Even more annoyingly is that they went up in price on Amazon TODAY! Only a couple of quid, but still it\u0026rsquo;s yet another thing to buy 😅. Here\u0026rsquo;s the quick shot I did, mostly pick the strips at random but I quite like the four slide montage of individuals.\nIt was quite an ordeal but makes the photos all the more enjoyable. All in all, I\u0026rsquo;m very happy with it. I\u0026rsquo;ll get to scanning them all at some point but I\u0026rsquo;m happy not to send B\u0026amp;W away to the lab now (although I still will for colour). Am I now going to be 100% film, and blasting through multiple rolls a day\u0026hellip;probably not, but now I won\u0026rsquo;t think quite so hard as to whether whatever we\u0026rsquo;re doing is enough to justify a roll of film.\n","date":"27 September 2022","permalink":"/posts/2022/first-successful-35mm-dev/","section":"Posts","summary":"I finally make it all work and develop my first roll of 35mm film","title":"My first successful 35 mm development"},{"content":"This isn\u0026rsquo;t my first attempt at film development, that was at the beginning of this year with trying out the 4x5 camera. I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to write about that for 9 months, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll get to it soon\u0026hellip; This was my first attempt at 35mm film though (black and white, obviously). Up to now I\u0026rsquo;ve just sent them away to filmdev.co.uk as they do a good job and are competitively priced. Although prices have gone up this year, so not quite as cheap as it used to be. I have thought of using them just for development and then scanning myself to save some money, but why not do the whole thing!\ntl;dr: It went badly. I\u0026rsquo;ve had all the stuff since last Christmas when I asked for it from family members - as no-one ever knows what to get for me. Although I don\u0026rsquo;t have a film canister opener. I did try using a bottle opener but it didn\u0026rsquo;t really work. I ended up just ripping the canister apart from the film leader gap. That worked quite well as I could hold the coiled film.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s do this! I don\u0026rsquo;t have a dark room, just a dark bag - as you can see - and loading the film into the spool was interesting. I was wearing some gloves to try and stop getting too much finger grease on the film but it was impossible to feel the film and the entrance to the spool. I ended up taking off one glove and then I could feel it better and feed it on to the spool. Once on, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to roll as you just turn the spool back and forth and it loads. It was surprisingly easy to do. I put it into the developing tank. The one I have can hold two spools but I thought I\u0026rsquo;d just try wrecking one film first (a good choice). I should\u0026rsquo;ve put it on the bottom of the tank and the blank on top to minimise the amount of chemicals I need, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t think about it at the time and just put it on the top to make it easier to load.\nNeed some tea after that strenuous work All ready to develop! It\u0026rsquo;s been 9 months since I last did it, and I realised I had forgotten most of what I needed to do. Some googling and I was all set. I had made some notes on what I did but I have no idea where I saved those as I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find them. I\u0026rsquo;ve since made a cheatsheet page on this site so I can find it in the future!\nChemicals a-ready At this stage I should\u0026rsquo;ve realised something wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite right. See that dark red solution? That\u0026rsquo;s the developer. I need to find my photo of my first development efforts, but as I was pouring it I did think it looked awfully dark. However, I did nothing and carried on regardless. My sister was staying at the time and she came to see what I was up to. She walked in to me saying \u0026ldquo;1 to 9; 450 ml\u0026rdquo; as I was trying to figure out the dilution ratios. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s me but I dislike ratios. Just make it a decimal. 🤓\nI assume the issue was dodgy developer but perhaps there was something else too?\nI use the Dev It app on my phone to manage the stages and times. I works pretty well and you can look up what others have used for the same film and solutions. After the developing, stopping, fixing, washing, agitating and timing, I was ready\u0026hellip;\nWell this doesn\u0026rsquo;t look good. My sister looks at it and says: \u0026ldquo;is that what it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be like?\u0026rdquo;. COMPLETELY BLANK. lolnope. We laugh a lot. 😂 Then I sighed. None of the pictures were anything special or particular, just the kids and us playing and out and about, but I was looking forward to seeing them. Well another lesson taught with brutal honesty by film\nSide story:\nAt university, I did natural sciences in the first year and one of those was physics. We had labs each week and at some stage we were doing optics, and the lab involved taking photos with a film camera. This was back when I had no idea about anything and just used a point and shoot the whole time. Anyway, I spent 3 hours doing the lab. Setting up things to photograph, changing the distance and aperture etc. I took the whole roll and went into the darkroom. Thinking about it now it seems wild we were just left to get on with the film development with just a piece of paper to explain. After all of that I take out my film and it looks remarkably like the blank one above. Turns out I hadn\u0026rsquo;t loaded it properly and it never wound on. 😢 The moment I took out this film I was reminded of that lab, one afternoon nearly 20 years ago. This time I know the film wound on, as the M2 has the rewind knob with the two red dots that turn and I reached the end as I couldn\u0026rsquo;t advance the film.\nCompared to a properly developed roll of HP5+ As part of my investigation into why, I got out another roll of HP5 that had been developed. I noticed the leader was perfectly black and the edges have some darkness on it. My film was perfectly clear the whole way. So that can\u0026rsquo;t be right as the leader had also been expose to the daylight. This suggested chemicals was the problem not the camera or loading etc. I get on the signal chat and ask my film development support team. Dodgy developer was the main suspect.\nI then take a look at the bottle of developer:\nRead the instructions This bottle was opened New Year\u0026rsquo;s Day 2022. Further forum reading suggests darkening is another symptom, particularly bad if it looks like strong tea.\nNow strong tea is something I can recognise.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve ordered some new chemical. Going with Kodak HC-110 this time. It keeps longer and is more economical per roll too, so that\u0026rsquo;s a bonus. I need to take some pictures and then give it another go. Hopefully third time\u0026rsquo;s the charm. Then I can enjoy the other eight rolls of HP5+ I\u0026rsquo;ve got waiting.\n","date":"21 September 2022","permalink":"/posts/2022/first-35mm-film-development/","section":"Posts","summary":"It doesn\u0026rsquo;t go well","title":"First attempt at 35mm development"},{"content":"","date":"17 September 2022","permalink":"/tags/leica/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Leica"},{"content":"","date":"17 September 2022","permalink":"/tags/photograpy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Photograpy"},{"content":" Exciting!

There was a gallery and various display cabinets. I could\u0026rsquo;ve spent hours there, but unfortunately I only had about 20 minutes between trains.\nI wanted to try out the M10, and I asked the white T-shirt\u0026rsquo;d hipster looking attendant if they had any I could try out. They only had a display M10-R as supposedly everything else was back at Wetzlar being looked over. I tried it with the 35mm summilux that was attached to it when he brought it out and then with the 90mm tele-elmarit I had with me. It felt exactly like holding the M2, it was unreal. The viewfinder was so bright and clear. It was lovely, and at that moment I was convinced I needed to get one.\nBut when I got home, and looked at the prices, that certainty started to dissolve.\nDuke Street, W1 ","date":"17 September 2022","permalink":"/posts/2022/visit-to-leica-store/","section":"Posts","summary":"A brief visit to the Leica store in Mayfair","title":"Visiting the London Leica Store"},{"content":"","date":"11 September 2022","permalink":"/tags/events/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Events"},{"content":"The Queen is travelling from Balmoral Castle to Edinburgh, and goes along the main road that\u0026rsquo;s a 10 minute walk from our house.

Kosmo Foto Mono is a 100-ISO panchromatic black-and-white film. I think I bought it as I liked the box design more than any meticulous research that I undertook. I think it\u0026rsquo;s made by Fomapan, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s quite different to the Fomapan line. They suggest you can pull it to 50 and push it to 400, which I think is unusal for a panchromatic film. I\u0026rsquo;ve not pushed it myself, and I shot it at the box 100 speed.\nThe photo that attracts the most remarks As I said, I bought it mostly on a whim, I think I was just picking a random selection of things to try out. It might\u0026rsquo;ve been on sale too. I took it with me in the M2 when we went out to Drum Castle - a historic family castle with woods and walled gardens to explore. Being ISO 100, it\u0026rsquo;s always a bit of a risk here in Scotland. A sunny day can quickly turn cloudy and then all of a sudden f/4 is starting to be a push, and then going into the woods means I\u0026rsquo;m down to f/1.4-2.8. However, I managed to get quite a few nice shots of the kids playing. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really study the photos too much, as I tend to get multiple films developed at once there\u0026rsquo;s more to look at.\nWhat caused me to go back and really look at them was that numerous people commented on how much they liked the photo above. My wife had used it in our family calendar for this year and so when it came to that month, everyone commented on it.\nWoods + B\u0026amp;W is a favourite It\u0026rsquo;s not a single thing that makes up a photo, but a combination of everything. I do think this particular B\u0026amp;W film stock looks good and compliments the scenes.\nSmile! It\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a niche stock and probably not all that available but if you do come across a roll, I\u0026rsquo;d suggest giving it a try.

I love the rangefinder focusing, and the feel and quality of it are outstanding. With a little care and maintenance this camera will last me another 60 years and beyond. My grandfather was a keen photographer and took many photos in his life. Unfortunately not many survived, and certainly none of his cameras. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if he ever had a Leica, I suspect not, but if he did then this could\u0026rsquo;ve been his. Even though it has no sentimental value, being from 1962 is the era of the few slide photos I do have from my grandfather, so it reminds me of him that way.\nIt is just a box, and it\u0026rsquo;s the lenses and film emulsion that truly make the photos, but it\u0026rsquo;s a box that makes you want to keep coming back to take more.

Navel or winter or Jaffa or whatever they\u0026rsquo;re called at various points of the year. They\u0026rsquo;re always big. Bigger than clementines or satsumas (what is the difference?) or other citrus fruit of that colour but which are smaller. They\u0026rsquo;re satisfying to eat, they fill you up somewhat, generally juicy, and a good size. They can be a pudding or a snack and you\u0026rsquo;re not looking around for another or something else. An all round good fruit.\nOne thing that I\u0026rsquo;ve found over the years of eating big oranges in public, is that not many people like big oranges. I\u0026rsquo;m surprised by this, given all the reasons I\u0026rsquo;ve stated why big oranges are good. What\u0026rsquo;s also surprising, but equally surprisingly common, is that people will comment about how the orange looks nice but state that they\u0026rsquo;d never eat one. They stand there and watch me take it out my bag or pick it up from its resting place on my desk and begin the peeling process. Maybe they mutter it, maybe they say it clear as day, or maybe they just think it, but it\u0026rsquo;s always the same: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d never eat a big orange\u0026rdquo;.\nNow is a good time to talk about the process of peeling a big orange. I think this is important as I think this is one of the main reasons why people don\u0026rsquo;t like eating big oranges. I could be wrong as I\u0026rsquo;ve never challenged people to why they\u0026rsquo;d never eat a big orange, out of respect of their life choices, but I reckon the peeling plus one other item is why.\nThe peeling process does depend on the type of orange. (I\u0026rsquo;m aware of Homer Simpson taking a marriage class, whilst Hans Moleman takes an orange eating class in a classic episode of The Simpson\u0026rsquo;s (S5E22 if you must know)).\nThe Orange Eating Class Anyway, if the skin is thick then it\u0026rsquo;s typically very easy to peel. A single peel is very achievable, even by the most novice of big orange eater. If the skin is thin then it can be slow going, especially if you get into the pick off tiny pieces mode. I recommend just skipping straight to the knife and cutting it into segments if you find yourself in this situation.\nStart by rolling it around in your hands, then alternative squeezing it with your thumbs. You\u0026rsquo;re trying to \u0026ldquo;soften it up\u0026rdquo; I find it helps relax or even break the bond of the skin to the segments. However, you don\u0026rsquo;t want to squeeze it too much as you might burst the cell walls and end up in a messy situation. The next stage is the first pierce of the skin. I like to find a spot around the Tropic of Cancer - imagine the orange as the Earth with the top that connects to the tree as the North Pole. You pinch the skin together a little to try and raise it away from the flesh. Do this with your thumb and index finger, then pierce the skin with your thumb. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to have big or sharp nails to do this. You need a nail but mine are short and work just fine. Once you\u0026rsquo;re in, then it\u0026rsquo;s about trying to pull away the skin without it breaking too soon. You\u0026rsquo;re trying to peel off a reasonable sized piece first, so that you have a good perimeter of skin in which to attack next. I use my thumb under the skin to separate it and work more of it away from the flesh. Once I have a decent sized piece, maybe 2\u0026quot; / 5 cm diameter piece, then I head up to the North Pole to pull out the pith stalk that\u0026rsquo;s inside. It has quite a big of friction and if you try with a too small piece of skin first then you risk breaking the skin away from the top and having to tackle it again in a harder manner. Once this is done then it\u0026rsquo;s a case of going around the rest of the skin with your thumb underneath and prising away more until it\u0026rsquo;s all done. Depending on the type of orange the South Pole can be tricker and generally messier. This is where you might get a belly button looking part which has lots of tiny segments inside all linked together in middle segment of a cone shape. Depending on what\u0026rsquo;s there I often find that leaving the very southern tip still with skin on and then opening up the orange into two halves makes getting this part out much easier. It\u0026rsquo;ll generally come away in two pieces on each half. It\u0026rsquo;ll have some orange on it that you could eat. However, if this is your first time I\u0026rsquo;d suggest just composting that part with the skin and worry about it another day.\nFrom there you can just peel off large chunks of white pith that you probably don\u0026rsquo;t want to eat and then peel each segment apart from the main group and enjoy. If the segments are torn or some came off with the skin then you just have to improvise and eat as it comes. This is a situation which I can very clearly see why some people would be put off. That brings us nicely to the second main reason why people don\u0026rsquo;t eat big oranges:\nThe Mess 😱 # This is particularly important when you\u0026rsquo;re not at home in the comfort of your own kitchen or shower. This is where people at work look at you dumbfounded. The risk you\u0026rsquo;ve introduced into the workplace by bringing, peeling and then eating a big orange when you never quite know the outcome of the peeling is, in many people\u0026rsquo;s view, unacceptable. The only credible mitigation that they\u0026rsquo;d accept is not eating the orange in the first place. Elimination, as the highest tier of risk mitigation strategy, is all they\u0026rsquo;d consider. This is where I feel they\u0026rsquo;re missing out. With great risk, comes great reward. That is not to say that I\u0026rsquo;ll risk it all, but with proper procedures and a competent operator, anyone can enjoy the fruits of a big orange.\nBut I understand. You don\u0026rsquo;t want orange juice on your hands, or face, or trousers or clothes or wherever, it\u0026rsquo;s messy, sticky, and ruins your look. Again, follow the process and you can be safe. If you\u0026rsquo;re really worried, find a sink and peel and eat the orange over it. Probably you want to practice this at home as you might get even more comments than merely eating a big orange in the first place. You can then direct any stray juice into the sink and wash your hands afterwards.\nSo I hope you can join me in the pleasure of eating a big orange wherever you may please and stand out amongst your peers.\n🧡🧡🧡\nIf I wanted to see a man eating an orange, I would\u0026rsquo;ve taken the orange-eating class!\n— Ground\u0026rsquo;s Keeper Willie 🍊\n","date":"22 June 2022","permalink":"/posts/2022/big-orange/","section":"Posts","summary":"Idle thoughts about the fruit","title":"Big Orange 🍊"},{"content":"","date":"22 June 2022","permalink":"/tags/random/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Random"},{"content":" It\u0026rsquo;s so tiny! Whilst I\u0026rsquo;d love to get a Leica Q2 or even a GRIII, they\u0026rsquo;re quite expensive (quite being the understatement on the Q2). I\u0026rsquo;m interested in getting a compact camera to just take anywhere without it being a big deal. My Fuji isn\u0026rsquo;t huge but it\u0026rsquo;s not something that fits in the pocket or near enough. These last two statements don\u0026rsquo;t really support the Q2 whatsoever - it\u0026rsquo;s not that compact and given its price, it\u0026rsquo;ll always be a big deal - but I still want one.\nThis may be an excuse to buy more camera gear with the weak premise that it\u0026rsquo;s furfilling some other duty or need but I don\u0026rsquo;t care. Particularly as I\u0026rsquo;m trying to find something that is cheap - ideally \u0026lt;£100 but we\u0026rsquo;ll see.\nTwo/three that I first found which are quite interesting are the Olympus Pen E-PM2 (or maybe the 1 but that might be too old) and the Lumix LX100. These are both micro 4/3s sensors, so a compromise on sensor size but the benefit of being small. Whilst the sensor size is smaller than even APS-C, it\u0026rsquo;s still massively bigger than a phone.\nThe Olympus has an interchangable lens, and so you need to find a pancake lens to keep the size down. It\u0026rsquo;s nearly 10 years old but still has a respectable sensor. I\u0026rsquo;m worried I like it as it\u0026rsquo;s then another money pit for new lenses. I could be fun for small telephoto lenses but I also don\u0026rsquo;t need them. I\u0026rsquo;m also concerned that lens creep would result in ending up with a camera just as big as my X-T2.\nThe Lumix LX100 looks really like a Fuji, and the lens says Leica. So what\u0026rsquo;s not to like! It\u0026rsquo; looks a bit old and, when turned on and the lens comes out, like quite big and unsubtle. However that\u0026rsquo;s not really that important. They also make a mark ii which has quite a few upgrades but also higher price. The zoom lens is a handy feature and I like how you can move between fixed focal lengths (e.g. 24, 28, 35 \u0026hellip;) rather than just a continous zoom. It\u0026rsquo;s also quite good on video\u0026hellip;not that I generally take much video.\nHowever, once I started this search the flood gates opened and every new camera I\u0026rsquo;d investigate there\u0026rsquo;d be 100 comments with 100 new models that everyone recommended as being \u0026ldquo;much better\u0026rdquo;. Some of them that I noticed but still to look into are:\nLecia TL Leica CL Olympus EP-5 Olympus pen-F Nikon Coolpix A Fuji XF10 Lumix GX9 Ricoh GR2 / GR3 Fuji X-E2/2s/3 Canon EOS M200 and EF-M 22mm f/2 Lumix GX880 Lumix GX80 These are becoming way beyond my cheap criteria, and has just become a research distraction.\nThen there is also getting a top end iPhone, because I\u0026rsquo;d always have it. Although it\u0026rsquo;s £1000 or whatever, and I don\u0026rsquo;t like taking pictures with a phone.\n","date":"21 June 2022","permalink":"/posts/2022/compact-cameras/","section":"Posts","summary":"An unnecessary journey into the world of compact cameras","title":"Compact Cameras"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve looked at them a few times over the years but never bought one. They are pretty expensive - I guess from import duties etc. from Japan - and, you know, it\u0026rsquo;s just a notebook. However, I saw that the 2H 2022 ones were up for pre-order at a local online store and so I went for it. Being half the year means that it was maybe half the price.\nJust half a year Look on reddit or forums or wherever and people rave about the quality and paper and how nice they feel. Again, something I didn\u0026rsquo;t really buy when reading about it online. However, I\u0026rsquo;m now in that camp of \u0026ldquo;ermahgard this is the nicest notebook I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had.\u0026rdquo;\nThe paper feels smooth and is remarkably well suited to just about any pen and ink type you have. Even the cover feels nice. A lot of people get covers and holders for their technos, which do offer benefits such as pen holders and extra pockets for cards or tickets etc., but the vanilla notebook seems durable enough to keep it bare.\nIt comes in A6, which I initially thought would be too small, but now I appreciate the small size, as it makes it easy to bring back and forth to work or anywhere else I want to take it.\nThe biggest difference to most other notebooks, even ones with fancy paper and covers, is the prescribed layout inside. There are a lot of sections inside it. It\u0026rsquo;s similar to a diary but there\u0026rsquo;s more than just days of the week. There\u0026rsquo;s a year index, a month calendar, the individual days, a timetable, a top 100 list, favourites list, contacts, and probably a few other things I\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten. The individual days have the date, the moon phase, time slots, a meal journal, and a todo list part. There\u0026rsquo;s just so much in it but it\u0026rsquo;s all very well organised and laid out.\nWhilst there\u0026rsquo;s a general way to use each section, you do have the freedom to do what you want. I like using the yearly index for a habit tracker, and the top 100 list for a book tracker. I\u0026rsquo;ve only just got mine so I might change these or find other uses.\nCutesy instructions included I could do all this with a blank notebook, and one at the fraction of the price. However, I quite like being told what to do. Like the defaults in software, good ones are well thought out and you\u0026rsquo;d be wise to at least try it that way.\nMy half year doesn\u0026rsquo;t start until 1st July, so I\u0026rsquo;m only partially using it right now. I\u0026rsquo;ll see how I get one once the month rolls around.

Sounds logically right? I managed to pick up a good deal on a Mac Mini. It was a 2012 model but top spec and still very performant today. The only bad thing is that it’s stuck on an older version of macOS. I even installed a 2 TB SSD so I could manage all our photos on it. I figured it would be nice to utilise Apple Photos and iCloud and get everything everywhere and all the moments, and “on this day” etc. that it gives you. It would also be a nice computer for learning some JavaScript and other general software dev stuff. The final decider was that I’d then have DayOne on a desktop machine. DayOne being where we keep the family journal.\nThe Mac, with the heat generating Apple Cinema HD It turns out that whilst that all may be very true, I’m unable to use a computer without wasting hours of time looking at random things online, and not actually accomplishing any of the things I’d told myself were the very reason I needed to get another computer. Maybe I did them some of the time but I wasn’t happy with it. I actually had two monitors and that made the desk look very cluttered as it came out at an angle into the desk top. Going back to the single monitor did make it look less overwhelming but it still didn’t change the fact that this extra computer was really one too many. We have five computers, and three raspberry pis, and a flock of iPads and Amazon tablets. I could probably manage without it.\nAnalogue mode: Expert So now it’s packed up and ready to be sold (as long as I’m certain) and the space cleared out. Originally I planned to just use it for paper, whether by pen or by typewriter, but I’ve actually found it’s a nice spot for the iPad with the Smart Keyboard. I recently had to wipe and reinstall iPadOS as it was having issues and because of the issues I didn’t want to restore it to how it was and just added apps as I went along. This meant it was quite bare. I tidied up the Home Screen and am trying to keep it limited in scope. It’s still just as easy to waste time on Reddit or the internet on the iPad as much as a desktop!\nTrying to keep it simple I have my main writing apps with 1Writer, Day One and WordPress. A few utilities, dynalist for lists, Fresco for my daughter to draw, and the Day One widget so I actually see some of the older entries without having to do anything. The second page of the iPad is some streaming apps and misc. things I use occasionally or if I go away.\nEven though I have a web browser, I’m less drawn to it on here than either dedicated apps or the browser on the desktop. Generally there aren’t apps on the desktop so it’s always the browser. Just these few small hurdles to overcome seem to be enough to stop me wasting away time and actually doing the things I set out to do in the first place.\nI still get sucked into random websites and whatever, either from emails or links people send me, but it’s usually not the default starting place it tends to be with a desktop. Plus the other fact of when I feel like pen and paper or typewriter, the iPad is small and easily moved out the way.\nI should sort out my e-ink screen and have something interesting show up on that whilst I sit here.\nColour e-ink is fun!

I think it was Christmas time 2018 when I bought the Iris keyboard as the store had a sale on. Funnily enough that was a split keyboard. I keep meaning to write up a post about all my mechanical keyboards (there’s been quite a few over the past nine years) and I’d enjoy going back and remembering what I had.\nMostly what happens is I buy a new kit or PCB thinking it’ll be the end game (after much research), build it, configure the layout, generally mess about, and then stop using it. After a few months I end up selling it online, probably to fund the next one. Building is a fun part of it, so perhaps nothing wrong with this cycle. Will this next one be any different, or have I just been distracted by film photography and other things the past 3-4 years?\nFive blue PCBs The Ferris Sweep # That’s the name of the new keyboard I’m going to build. A friend sent me a video of it a while ago and I decided I absolutely needed it. It’s a derivative of the Ferris keyboard, but instead of various individual components on the board, it makes use of a microcontroller. This means it’s a lot easier to build and microcontrollers are pretty common across mechanical keyboards. There might be some other changes too but I didn’t spend much time looking at the Ferris.\nThe final parts just arrived and so I’ve yet to build it, the featured image is one like what I’m going to build but I went with blue PCB and white keycaps. It was pretty easy to source, the Github repo has a .gerber file which you can upload to a PCB manufacturer’s website and they’ll print them off for you (minimum of 5). It’s remarkable, and pretty cheap – $20 for 5, and then $15 for postage and taxes. Unfortunately that’s where the cheapness ends. Now this is by no means an expensive keyboard on the scale of mechanical keyboards, but it’s not nothing. The rest of the parts – controllers, switches, caps, etc. – soon add up and whilst there are a lot of stores that sell these parts, not all of them have everything you need – least not ones in the UK. I ended up ordering everything else from splitkbd.com. This store is based in EU and does have excellent stock – just it’s a €25 postage, so make sure you have everything you need!\nEverything else you need I went with Sweepv2.2 and pink Kailh choc keys, these are the lightest pressure ones. The next thing will be to solder it all together, flash the controller and get typing! Well, try typing. Making a new layout will be the longest part, likely involving many iterations if I truely want to stick to it.\nWill I stick with it? You never know! 😅\nUpdate 31st July 2022 # I build it, flashed the stock firmware and tested it out. All but one key works. Probably need to check the solder. However, that\u0026rsquo;s as far as I took it from back in May. It\u0026rsquo;s sat on my desk reminding me that I wasted money on it. I have just sold one of the spare PCBs on ebay, so that gets a little money back.

Afraid it\u0026rsquo;s been taken down now, and lives at home with me!\nTehachapi, CA at night I had some friends who were keen to go astrophotography shooting and invited me along one evening. We drove out to the mountains and tried several places to take pictures. Prior to going I’d done a little research into how you actually take photos of the sky at night. At the time all I had was the Fuji X100F with it’s 23mm f/2. This turned out to be a good lens, it’s fast and wide-ish. If I had the WCL that would’ve made it a 18mm f/2 and perhaps even better, however, I didn’t so I just used what I had.\nWe took quite a lot and it was hard to tell if anything was good or bad or what. This particular one was taken near the main highway just off some side farm road. It was so dark I couldn’t see anything and just aimed the camera on the tripod in the general direction. I probably couldn’t have lined up the telegraph wires better if I tried! This was back in 2017 and we had a good night and finished it with a stop at a MacDonald’s on the highway for hot chocolate. I also got the photo printed to give to one of my friends who went with us that night as a leaving gift.\nFujifilm X100F Fast forward to September 2020, and Fujifilm announced the 10th anniversary of the X100 series competition. You can submit any photo as long as it has been taken with a X100 series camera. As most of my photos are of family and friends, I didn’t have too many that might be suitable and this astro shot was the one I immediately thought of. The first prize was a brand new, shiny X100V. They had multiple first prizes for different regions, so I wasn’t competing against everyone, just everyone in the UK!\nThe following February I got an email saying I was one of the 10 runners up! Woohoo! 🎉 (although would’ve been nice to win the camera given I’d just recently sold my X100F and was missing it a little bit 📷). My prize was a nice tote bag, and a hand written congratulations note. The other part was that they would print and display the photo in their gallery.\nThe Prize Except then COVID had locked everything down and they decided to postpone it a few times. However, now the gallery is open! Unfortunately, I live a long way from London and I’m not going there any time soon, so I won’t get to see it in person. They have offered to post it up to me after the exhibition, so that’ll be nice.\nThe Fujifilm store looks like a nice play to go if you like photography and cameras, they always have gallery one and no doubt lots of toys to play with.\nI believe it’s was open now until 30th June 2022. Have a look at their site.\nUpdate: They\u0026rsquo;ve since posted the framed version to me at home. Now I just need to decide what I\u0026rsquo;m doing with it.\n","date":"13 May 2022","permalink":"/posts/2022/i-have-a-photo-in-an-actual-gallery/","section":"Posts","summary":"As seen in a London gallery!","title":"I have a photo in an actual gallery 🌌"},{"content":"A while back I decided I needed (yes, needed) another laptop. I do have a Thinkpad T450s already but my daughter has pretty much taken it completely and uses it for school work. So I went on the hunt for a new one. I wanted it to have USB-C so that I could use my existing dock and setup at home that I have from working at home with my work laptop.\n![Prepare the work area](thinkpad-t490-thumb.JPEG \u0026ldquo;Prepare the work area)\nI started trying to figure out which model was the oldest I could get, but then saw that I should try and find one with the 8th intel cpu (or higher) as these were the low powered quad core CPUs which had a much bigger performance boost compared to previous generational increases. This meant T490(s) or 6th gen X1 Carbon (2018). It was pretty easy to find out that the T490 was the cheapest, and offered the most ports and expandability.\nI found a bargain on eBay but lo-and-behold the screen was a horrible 1366×768. I thought they stopped selling laptops with such dire screens. But no, and in fact you can still get models with them today from Lenovo. I later rechecked the listing and it conveniently didn’t specify anything about the screen resolution.\nI had the choice of sending it back and buying a new one, (or sending it back and not getting another as why do I need six computers in the house), living with it, or upgrading the screen. I did upgrade the screen of my X230 about 5 years ago and that was pretty easy. It looked like buying a replacement screen would be the cheapest. Especially if I can sell the old screen to recoup some money.\nFinding the right model to get was pretty straight forward. A quick visit to /r/thinkpad and searching for screen replacement so led to finding out which model is best to get. There’s also this review of screens by notebookcheck. Supposedly it’s the Innolux N140HCG-GQ2, and this is what I bought from an interestingly named store of Softhands.co.uk. I’ve just noticed there’s a B1 version but don’t know if it’s better.\nPlastic clips and a bit of stick is all the keeps the screen attached More sticky holds the bezel and screen together The best part There are a couple of videos on YouTube showing you how to do it, and even some videos by Lenovo. Like all ThinkPads there’s the service manual which has a lot of good information for any upgrade or repair you might want to me.\nI used a small screw driver to start separating the bezel from the lid and then a metal credit card to separate it further. There are a few sticky parts that need pulling apart. You need to apply more force than you think to get it to separate.\nScreen connector Detaching the cable is the fiddliest part. There’s a catch to lift up and over and then the connector slides out parallel to the main board towards the lid. I have some pointy nose tweezers that helped with this part. Getting this back in when reassembling is equally fiddly and you need to make sure it goes all the way in so that the two parts are flush together.\nThe first boot and the Lenovo logo appeared but then it all went blank. Oh uh! I restarted and went into the BIOS – the screen was working fine again – poked about in the settings but there wasn’t anything to do regarding the screen so I restarted and, Success! Windows booted and I could change the resolution to 1920×1080. 🎉\nThere is a balance between screen area, resolution and pixel density. I find native 1080p a good balance between them on a 14” screen. A higher resolution and everything gets too small to read. You can up the scaling but then you start to lose space, also I find non-integer scaling, such as 1.5 or 150%, can sometimes lead to funny text or other UI annoyances. It’s been a while since I tried, so I’m sure OSs have improved this. You can avoid this by going with a 4K screen and doing 200% scaling, and it looks lovely, probably also because the panel has full colours and great brightness.\nSo if you have a low resolution screen, I’d definitely encourage you to look into replacing it yourself. Now I’m off to install Linux on it! 🐧\nThis is what you want to see ","date":"7 May 2022","permalink":"/posts/2022/upgrading-my-t490-to-1080p/","section":"Posts","summary":"Replacing the screen on my laptop","title":"Upgrading my T490 to 1080p"},{"content":"For my Meditations Tiddlywiki, I wanted to make each statement an individual tiddler. Whilst it doesn\u0026rsquo;t add a great deal to the site right now (beyond just viewing the minimum amount, the random tiddler button, and following the tiddlywiki mantra), I think it\u0026rsquo;ll be useful later on. Over time I\u0026rsquo;d like to add my own thoughts or interpretations to them, or maybe categorise favourite ones with new tags. Plus they might be useful for other people who can export tiddlers or download the file.\nI had the site previously but it was one tiddler per book, and that didn\u0026rsquo;t make it very usable beyond just reading.\nI find the easiest way to import lots of tiddlers is via a JSON file. Luckily I\u0026rsquo;d found a JSON file of Meditations some time ago. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to find the text but that\u0026rsquo;s not always as easily parsed as as structured document. The JSON was just book and then each line. I still needed to get the title, tags, and fields sorted out before I could import into a blank Tiddlywiki.\nThe general structure of JSON to be imported looks like this:\n[ { \u0026#34;created\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;20211215114254021\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;More content\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Home [[Book 1]]\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2nd tiddler\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;modified\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;20211215114322673\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;book\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;section\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;12\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;created\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;20211215112427768\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Content\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Home\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Meditations\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;modified\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;20211215112535190\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;section\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;book\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2\u0026#34; } ] The section and book are fields I added and the rest should be obvious. Tags with spaces need to be in [[ ]]. So all I\u0026rsquo;d need to do is iterate over the JSON file and create new entries that matched this structure.\nThe first issue I came across was knowing how many sections per book there are. I made a new list of the number of sections and stored that in the meditations.json file. Whilst not necessary (as I could\u0026rsquo;ve used the code to generate this later on), I thought it might be helpful and more efficient to compute it once and store the results. data is the json file as you\u0026rsquo;ll see shortly.\nsectionCount = [len(data[\u0026#34;meditations\u0026#34;][f\u0026#34;{x}\u0026#34;]) for x in range(1,13)] So now that I have everything it was just a case of building the list in the format I wanted and writing it to a file.

A very accessible one is from Practical Business Python. Always a great site for python in the workplace for non-devs. However, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find one that did just what I wanted, namely, take a model I\u0026rsquo;d already built in Excel and then apply some randomness and plot the S-curve (cumulative distribution function).\nMaybe if I\u0026rsquo;d searched more I\u0026rsquo;d find one but instead I just got on with it. I also used to have some software at work that did this for me, it was an add-on to Excel but work stopped paying for it and I found it hard to justify it (it\u0026rsquo;s an Oracle product so no doubt pricey). Plus I always love an excuse to try and learn a bit more python.\nBackground # If you don\u0026rsquo;t know, Monte Carlo simulation is a way to capture uncertainity. If a friend is driving to your house, 50 miles away, and they travel at 50 mph it\u0026rsquo;ll take then one hour right? Well, not always. Maybe they are keen on the gas and drive faster, or maybe there\u0026rsquo;s an accident and they get stuck. You just never know. So you could use monte carlo to say that their average journey speed could be from 40-60 mph, then you randomly sample many many times from that range and work out the time it takes. Do it 10,000 times and you then have 10,000 results that you can draw estimates from, e.g. the average time. You can also plot the results and show the whole range.\nTools # The main python tools to get this working is numpy for the random sampling and xlwings for interacting with Excel. Like all python libraries, these tools do way more than just what I need. I also used pandas, seaborn and matplotlib. Probably unnecessary but they\u0026rsquo;re quick to work with as I already know the gist of them.\nThen of course there\u0026rsquo;s Excel, which needs no introduction. I\u0026rsquo;d already built my deterministic model in Excel, where all my inputs were in one table that could be changed and then the outputs were in another to be read.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s always going to be the choice of what do you do in python and what do you do in Excel. As I\u0026rsquo;d started in Excel I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to waste time recreating stuff in python so all the calculations are in Excel. This is slow (but still fast enough for my use case). Depending on how advanced or complex your model becomes it may be better to move more of it to Excel. The trade off with this is now only you can use it or understand it.\nBefore I forget, there\u0026rsquo;s also VS Code. I use it at work as it\u0026rsquo;s free, I can install it without Admin rights and IT department haven\u0026rsquo;t questioned me on it (yet!), unlike PyCharm 🤔. I like to make use of the #%% cell divider in it. Partially as I\u0026rsquo;d been using this for a long time with Spyder (before VS Code existed) and also as it seems like a better way to work vs. notebooks. At least for me.\nAs always the documentation of the libraries is a great place to start - often the best place before you jump to tutorials.\nThe Randomness # Your uncertainity takes shape in many different ways. Sometimes is a continuous range, like our speed example before, or it\u0026rsquo;s discrete, like picking your starter Pokémon. In fact whatever the uncertainity is, numpy has a method to help you represent it. I actually think working out what your uncertainity looks like is the hardest part of all of it. Perhaps you could even have uncertainity on the uncertainity\u0026hellip;Generally you want to ask an expert, maybe yourself, maybe someone else in your company, or whatever you can find online that seems reasonable. You can, of course, just try different ones in your model and see if it actually makes a difference to the decision you\u0026rsquo;re trying to make.\nI ened up using choice and uniform distributions. Choice being my starter Pokémon, and uniform distribution being a range of numbers but they\u0026rsquo;re all equally likely to be picked.\nMy choice was actually choosing a range of numbers in Excel which would all change depending on what choice was picked.\nThe Code # So in all its glory:\nimport pandas as pd import numpy as np import seaborn as sns import xlwings as xw import matplotlib.pyplot as plt sns.set_style(\u0026#39;whitegrid\u0026#39;) # Setup excel = r\u0026#34;myexcel.xlsx\u0026#34; wb = xw.Book(excel) sheet = wb.sheets[\u0026#39;Control Sheet\u0026#39;] rng = np.random.default_rng() iterations = 1000 POWER_LOWER = 100 POWER_UPPER = 120 CAPITAL_LOWER = 10000 CAPITAL_HIGHER = 30000 CO2_OPTIONS = [1, 2, 3] npv = [] for i in range(iterations): power_price = rng.uniform(low=POWER_LOWER, high=POWER_UPPER) capital_cost = rng.uniform(low=CAPITAL_LOWER, high=CAPITAL_HIGHER) co2_price = np.random.choice(CO2_OPTIONS) sheet.range(\u0026#39;B3\u0026#39;).value = power_price / 80 sheet.range(\u0026#39;B4\u0026#39;).value = capital_cost sheet.range(\u0026#39;B9\u0026#39;).value = co2_price npv_new = sheet.range(\u0026#39;B7\u0026#39;).value npv.append(npv_new) results = pd.DataFrame(data={\u0026#39;NPV10 £MM\u0026#39;: npv}) P90 = results.quantile(0.9)[0] P50 = results.quantile(0.5)[0] P10 = results.quantile(0.1)[0] EV = results.mean()[0] sns.displot(results, kind=\u0026#34;ecdf\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;EV: £{EV:.1f}MM, P10: £{P10:.1f}MM, P50: £{P50:.1f}MM, P90: £{P90:.1f}MM\u0026#34;) I made a few controls at the top so I could adjust the ranges of things. Fairly basic stuff otherwise, which I\u0026rsquo;m sure can be done better but was good enough for me. Being so simple makes it pretty easy to understand, even if you\u0026rsquo;ve never used these libraries before.\nThe whole thing is a loop that does the random sampling, insert those values into excel, excel then recalculates, then it takes the answer out and appends it to a list. Repeat that iterations times and there\u0026rsquo;s my data.\nI create a pandas dataframe (probably lazy and it could be done in numpy but as I said, lazy.) from the list and then calculate some metrics from it. The P values are commonly used at work to express the range. Where P90 meaning 90% probability that the value is ≤ X. Or often viewed as most optimistic result, with P10 therefore being the most pessimistic result. Actually, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen companies define these in reverse so check before you confuse people.\nSeaborn has a handy empirical cumulative distribution function (ecdf), that saves me thinking anything whatsoever (that\u0026rsquo;s the whole objective whilst at work right?). So I make one of those for the PowerPoint, and print out the final numbers in a nice line.\nThe other nice thing with VS Code is the data viewer. I can save the plot to a file and copy and paste the table of results straight from it without having to write it to a file first. Tiny things like that make life so much easier.\nConclusion # So pretty straight forward to make your deterministic Excel model into a fully probabilistic model capturing all the uncertainity and demonstrating all the potential outcomes that can happen. For free, in about 30 minutes of work.\nI think probabilistic models should be used more often. Very rarely is it that everything is always known exactly and whilst your calculation isn\u0026rsquo;t wrong, it\u0026rsquo;s only one possible outcome. Better to give your decision maker (or yourself) a range of outcomes than just one. Tell them \u0026ldquo;they\u0026rsquo;re buying the curve\u0026rdquo;. Then hope the final result actually lands on the curve 😅\n","date":"25 November 2021","permalink":"/posts/2021/monte-carlo-simulation-in-excel-with-python/","section":"Posts","summary":"Simulating the possible with python and excel","title":"Monte Carlo Simulation in Excel with Python"},{"content":" Yes, I\u0026rsquo;m very fond of tea.

I\u0026rsquo;ve read similar posts like these and found them useful to get ideas about what to do myself. Hopefully in turn, by presenting my setup it\u0026rsquo;ll give you some ideas too.\nAt the core of system is beancount. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain it a little more shortly, but essentially it is a tool that reads a plain text file of my financial activity and undertakes double-entry accounting in order to easily assess my finances in any way imaginable. My whole system actually involves several other tools and services in order to make it work how I want.\nUsing a tool like beancount means I am free to set everything up the way I want that works for me, and not the way someone thinks I want it. It also means my data is free from constraints.\nWhat I wanted # Data stored in plain text Add information quickly, and from anywhere A tool that could do everything - transactions, multiple currencies, stocks, investing, taxes, etc. A tool that could answer any question I had about my finances Fancy graphs on a website I could safely access anywhere This is what I have.\nThe Background # tl;dr ledger-cli like financial tools are the best.\nFinding your system takes time and there can be many decisions to make. It took me a long time to realise the benefit of tracking my expenses and what my money was doing. When I did first start I used YNAB, You Need A Budget. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really need a budget. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t living pay cheque to pay cheque and had some savings, but I had no idea how much I should or could save a year or how much was I actually spending. What really was the cost of that holiday? My friend had started using YNAB, and I picked it up in a Steam sale for $15. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty decent, easy to use, import transactions, tracking, graphs. I liked it. The first problem I found was that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t setup for more than one currency. If you wanted more you had to make two separate budgets, and this meant that my expense categories ended up being a bit weird and after about 9 months of use I found I hadn\u0026rsquo;t set them up well. This ultimately meant I could get the information I wanted out of the tool. I could go back and adjust all the expenses into different accounts but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to spend that time, and even then I\u0026rsquo;d still have to export everything into a spreadsheet to do further calculations. I\u0026rsquo;d also read some rumours that the next version was going to be a web only tool.\nNow YNAB keeps it\u0026rsquo;s data in some particular way and whilst there\u0026rsquo;s an export all function from the tool, I was worried about longevity of it. This was reinforced when they released the new version that is web only and announced they\u0026rsquo;d stop support for the desktop application after one year. Probably it\u0026rsquo;ll work for many years forward, but one day something will be changed and it\u0026rsquo;ll cease to work. Also the new version was going to have a monthly subscription\u0026hellip;\nSo I started my search for alternatives. Another feature I wanted was for it to be open source and natively run on linux, YNAB did via wine, but certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t open source and that always bugged me. I try to encourage others to support and use open source and here I was doing the opposite. I had kept a duplicate ledger using GNUCash when I started with YNAB to see if I liked either of them, and I installed KMyMoney and even tried LibreOffice database program but they all had annoyances with multiple currencies and other things. Having something that could manage multiple currencies turned out to be my main decision criteria, and that\u0026rsquo;s when I finally sat down and read the ledger manual.\nFor about 3 months I started using YNAB and ledger side by side and I came to realise that ledger was the perfect tool for me. It effortlessly handles multiple currencies, I can query my data any which way I like and all my data is stored as plain text I can version control and easily read for the rest of my life. Actually, I started with beancount first for a week or two but then switched to ledger. After four months I ended up going back to beancount.\nBeancount # If you\u0026rsquo;ve got here and don\u0026rsquo;t know what double-entry accounting or beancount or ledger are, I\u0026rsquo;m going to link you to this great site which explains it all.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also going to save why I chose beancount over ledger for another post. The basics are:\nBeancount (like HLedger) reads the file then orders the transactions before processing; Ledger processes them in the order they appear. This means with beancount I can lay out my files anyway I want. Strict rules on writing transaction. This is the bit I touch, I\u0026rsquo;m bound to do it wrong. Being able to close accounts when they\u0026rsquo;re done, so they don\u0026rsquo;t appear anymore in reports etc. Cleaner (in my opinion) way of balance assertions I found the query syntax easier to understand and some other misc things. The thing that made me switch? Seeing fava. This is an awesome project and the author has made several other contributions to the beancount world, one of which is the organised docs.\nBeancount is by no means perfect, but it fits well in my system.\nThe System # Now to talk about the parts that make up my finances system. These are all the tools/apps that I use which I\u0026rsquo;ll explain.\nComponents:\nbeancount: The accounting tool written and maintained by Martin Blais. fava A web interface to my data. Here\u0026rsquo;s a demo. spacemacs: Emacs and Vim ready to go. stackedit: In-browser editor. Many alternatives out there. Google Keep: Google\u0026rsquo;s note taking tool - good for quick notes on my phone on the go. Python price importer script: Of my own creation Dropbox: Cross platform file syncing tool pythonanywhere: Host, run, and code Python in the cloud. Gitlab: Git as a service, and unlimited free private repos. The whole system is based around writing transactions that beancount can process and then analysing the data through fava.\nThe other tools aid me in doing this at home and away, although away generally means at work.\nEntering Data # At home # Plain text means any text editor will do. However, some people have written helpers, namely for emacs, vim, and sublime. These generally auto complete account names and maybe a few other features like aligning the numbers and running bean-check to look for errors. The emacs beancount minor mode, written by Martin, has the most features - although not as many as ledger-mode, and if you already use emacs then it\u0026rsquo;s a no brainer. I\u0026rsquo;d tried emacs and vim in the past as I was curious as to what they were all about but as I\u0026rsquo;m not a developer and spend more time in Excel than anything else I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the time to learn them to get the most out of it.\nWhen I was using ledger I spent time in setting up emacs but it was all a bit messy and I felt like I was spending a lot of time just trying to setup emacs and not really doing what I wanted to be doing (plotting more account graphs of course!), that\u0026rsquo;s when I found spacemacs. This is a great project and bakes a whole load of great emacs plugins into a single and managed distribution. I probably only use a tiny percentage of the features but for editing and adding transactions is very slick. Check it out if you haven\u0026rsquo;t. Sublime text would probably be my next best option for editing my beancount file. It\u0026rsquo;s a lot easier to get started with and has some autocompletion, but not that great.\nAnother reason why I stuck with emacs was to use org mode to structure my file. With Ledger I quickly found having one file with everything didn\u0026rsquo;t work too well. Especially when using xacts comand from emacs to add a transaction, so I split it into individual account files and added includes to my master ledger file. This was okay, but meant I had to move between a lot of files and as ledger doesn\u0026rsquo;t rearrange transactions some reports and queries gave weird outputs. I worked around this by telling ledger to print everything to a ledger.all file then running queries and reports on that, but that was a pain. Probably there\u0026rsquo;s a better way to do it but I never found it.\nAnyway\u0026hellip;I now have one file that\u0026rsquo;s broken into headers with org and I just open or close them to see transactions. e.g.\nOptions Accounts Assets Bank 1 Bank2 Liabilities Credit Card 1 Mortgage Loan 2 I\u0026rsquo;m still learning all the keyboard commands but I can quickly add new transactions and make changes. I don\u0026rsquo;t use any importer tools (tools to take csv/ofx file from bank and convert into beancount input) as I tend to update once a week and there aren\u0026rsquo;t many transactions to add each time. Plus I like to look at each one and think about what we bought and if it was really worth it. This one looks promising, and Martin is working on a feature as part of beancount to do this.\nThese are the beancount minor-mode keys:\nKey | Action | Description \u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;- | \u0026mdash;- \u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;- | \u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash; C-c \u0026rsquo; | Insert Account | Bring up selection to choose an account C-c C-g | Set transaction flag | Change ! to * C-c r | Refresh account list | Read the file to update accounts for using C-c ' C-c l | Runs bean-check | Opens a new window with the results C-c q | Query | Runs bean-query C-c x | Context | Shows other transaction related, bean-doctor context C-c k | Linked | Shows related transactions. Seems to be the same as context. C-c ; | Align to previous number | Aligns the costs to the transaction above C-c : | Align numbers | Should align all the numbers but doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for me. Could be spacemacs issue though.\nSpacemacs has good completion from helm (I think!) so I don\u0026rsquo;t use insert account. Mostly use the transaction flag, running bean-check and aligning to previous numbers.\nOnce I\u0026rsquo;ve updated my transactions I commit the changes and push to my private repo on gitlab.\nAnd Away # Sometimes I want to add some transactions when I\u0026rsquo;ve got some spare time at work, to save doing it at home in the evening, or if I\u0026rsquo;m away. All this really means is I need some way of editing my files from another computer. Depending on that other computer it can be really easy or really hard. My work is somewhere in between, I can generally access most websites but I can\u0026rsquo;t install anything and SSH is blocked. Other computers I\u0026rsquo;d use might be at someone\u0026rsquo;s house or in a public place and generally all I can guarantee is web access.\nAgain, even just web access there are a multitude of options and I keep looking out for better ones. However, as it currently stands I use dropbox and stackedit. Dropbox also acts as a nice way to sync the file between my computers at home, and it offers version control from the website for every time the file is saved - which I\u0026rsquo;ve used! Dropbox doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a built-in editor, or it certainly doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for .beancount files, so I need something else to edit it. That\u0026rsquo;s where I use stackedit. It can open files from Dropbox and Google Drive and save things to various places too. It\u0026rsquo;s meant as an authoring site for websites as it\u0026rsquo;s primarily a markdown editor. There are a bunch of these sites so whichever you like. Writebox for Chrome is also a nice app. There\u0026rsquo;s no autocompletion or fancy features but generally I\u0026rsquo;m copying and pasting old transactions and updating the date and amount 90% of the time. It\u0026rsquo;s not as efficient but if I\u0026rsquo;m making use of deadtime it\u0026rsquo;s efficient to me.\nFor quick notes from my phone, such as significant cash transactions or ones with store cards I rarely use (and often forget to check), I use google keep. I can add a note very quickly and it saves the time and date automatically and I just add the key info. I then look at this later and transcribe into beancount at home and archive the note. I use Google Keep for other random notes but any note app you use would work. The key was finding something with a good mobile interface for quick input.\n2016-03-03 Update: I now use Gitlab to host my beancount files so I only update on the gitlab website if I\u0026rsquo;m not at home. Although I\u0026rsquo;ve found it better just to use Google Keep and update properly at home (I always forget to pull changes when at home!).\nBeancount Setup # One of the hardest parts to getting to use beancount was navigating the docs to figure out how to use it. Not that the docs are bad in content, far from it. Martin writes huge quantities of high quality documents. These are hosted on google docs and makes it super easy for others to comment, make corrections and ask questions. No other project have I been able to so easily make updates or clarify points as easily. The only downside is you can\u0026rsquo;t search across all of the files to find some particular item. Generally I have to open up two or three docs that I think the answer might be in. When I first started using it I literally opened every doc in a separate tab and read through them all and constantly reference between them. Dominik Aumayr has made a nice sphinx generated site that pulls these links together although with the docstrings from the code in his site. You\u0026rsquo;ll still need to read a lot of them but it\u0026rsquo;s a good starting place, and I think him and Martin are working to pull the content of Google Docs into it.\nSo read all the docs!\nThese are good to get going:\nGetting started Tutorial Cookbooks I\u0026rsquo;m only going to show you the basics to get started, and point out some (probably not all) the differences to ledger.\nCompared to ledger, beancount requires more \u0026ldquo;settings\u0026rdquo; in the file. You have to open all your accounts, declare commodities and generally be more descriptive. I like this as it reduces the chances of errors in either what I type in or what beancount thinks I want to happen.\nYour file.beancount # So a basic file will start like:\n;; -*- mode: org; mode: beancount; -*- ;; My legder file * Options ; Beancount options option \u0026#34;title\u0026#34; \u0026#34;My Finances\u0026#34; option \u0026#34;operating_currency\u0026#34; \u0026#34;USD\u0026#34; ; The main currencies you use option \u0026#34;operating_currency\u0026#34; \u0026#34;ABC\u0026#34; option \u0026#34;operating_currency\u0026#34; \u0026#34;GBP\u0026#34; ** Accounts ; Open all the accounts you have 2016-02-28 open Assets:BC:Bank:Checking ABC ; You can specify commodities 2016-02-28 open Assets:US:Bank:Savings 2016-02-28 open Liabilities:UK:Bank:Loan 2016-02-28 open Liabilities:US:Bank:Credit 2016-02-28 open Equity:Opening-Balances ; When you start you have existing balances ; one way to manage this is to have an opening balance transaction. ; Alternatively you can use balance and pad. ** Opening Balances 2016-02-28 * \u0026#34;Opening Balances\u0026#34; Assets:BC:Bank:Checking 1000.00 ABC Assets:US:Bank:Savings 500.00 USD Liabilities:UK:Bank:Loan -1000.00 GBP Liabilities:US:Bank:Credit -1890.00 USD Equity:Opening-Balances * Commodities ; Declaring cash and stocks and imaginary commodities you use * Banking ; Keep transactions under here for banks - US + Bank 1 ; Org more sub headings for each country/bank * Liabilities ; e.g. credit card transactions ; again sub divided by country/accounts * Investments ; accounts related to investing * Another other accounts or ways to divide up your system * Prices ; Price data, or maybe an include to a price file It\u0026rsquo;s probably worthwhile looking at some of the example beancount files Martin has in his repo. Either example.beancount or files under the folders.\nA basic transaction looks like this:\nYYYY-MM-DD * \u0026#34;Payee\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Optional Description\u0026#34; #optional-tag Account:Category:Sub-Category 1234.00 XYZ Account:Category:Sub-Category -123.34 XYZ ;Optional Comment Account:Category:Sub-Category Some differences from ledger:\nAccount can only be: Assets Liabilities Equity Income Expenses The * has to be present, or it can be a !. Generally ! means uncleared and * cleared. The payee and description must be in \u0026ldquo;quotes\u0026rdquo;. Tags are # Prices are in this format: 2016-02-25 price GBP 1.40 USD You have unlimited sub-categories, but a good design is: Account:Country:Institution:Account-type\ne.g. Assets:US:Chase:Checking\nFor expenses I got a lot of good inspiration from the Mint list. However, I\u0026rsquo;d suggest you start small and grow as you use it.\nAnalysing data in your browser # This is my favourite part! You can do everything from the command line but I really enjoy the fava tool to explore my data:\nInstructions to install it from the github repo: Install it from pip:\nsudo pip3 install beancount-fava From command line run it with:\nfava /Volumes/Ledger/example.beancount Go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000\nIt\u0026rsquo;s mostly self explanatory to navigate and use. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to check out the demo.\nBeancount includes the bean-query command which allows you to enter sql like code (bql - bean query language) to generate some reports. Fava has a view that allows you to enter your bql and see the result on the page and even export the data to CSV/Excel. Here\u0026rsquo;s a brief example:\nGo to Custom Query and enter:\nSELECT month, account, sum(number) as Total, currency FROM year = 2016 WHERE account ~ \u0026#39;Expenses\u0026#39; OR account ~ \u0026#39;Income\u0026#39; GROUP BY month, account, currency ORDER BY month, currency, Account FLATTEN If you add them to your beancount file using query entry and then they appear as options on the web UI\n2016-02-20 query \u0026#34;Monthly Totals - 2016\u0026#34; \u0026#34; SELECT month, account, sum(number) as Total, currency FROM year = 2016 WHERE account ~ \u0026#39;Expenses\u0026#39; OR account ~ \u0026#39;Income\u0026#39; GROUP BY month, account, currency ORDER BY month, currency, Account FLATTEN \u0026#34; A bean-query cookbook site has started where you can submit your queries and see others, check it out for more ideas. The full bean-query documentation is here.\nBeancount data analysis extras # The only other analysis I do is taking the monthly summary data and putting it into a Google docs spreadsheet. This is so I can do some forecasting on how much I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to spend this year and then how much I could save. When I first started tracking expenses I became a bit obsessed and didn\u0026rsquo;t buy anything, I was trying to maximise how much I saved. However, this soon got tiring and a little depressing. Yes, saving for the future/rainy days is very important but I should still be able to enjoy myself now. I figured it would be better if I had a target savings amount, and as long as I met that, I could spend the rest on \u0026ldquo;luxuries\u0026rdquo;. In fact this probably helps me reach my goals but not making saving a chore. So the spreadsheet estimates how much I could save and then I set my target based on that. When I want to buy something I don\u0026rsquo;t need, like a new camera, I can see what my trend is and know either if I can get it or how long I should wait before I can buy it.\nThis is only going to get easier once PIVOT BY is released for bean-query.\nWithin beancount itself there is the bean-report function, a lot (perhaps all) of these reports are covered in fava but it\u0026rsquo;s a quick tool to spit out something if you need it in a hurry from the command line.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re generated with bean-report FILENAME.beancount {report name}. Running \u0026ndash;help against bean-report will show a list of the reports and what they do. This can also print out your transactions in hledger/ledger format in case you want to use one of those tools, although special features of (h)ledger may not be covered.\nFree fava hosting # Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be great to access fava, this incredible tool, from anywhere? Given the demo is hosted on pythonanywhere, I figured I should be able to host my own beancount file there too. Plus I knew from using pythonanywhere before there\u0026rsquo;s a really easy password protection option you can setup to keep your data hidden. So here\u0026rsquo;s what to do:\nSetup # Create an account at pythonanywhere.\nAdd a new web app:\nManual configuration Python 3.4 Once it\u0026rsquo;s made, edit WSGI under Code and replace everything with this. Adjust the location of your file and config.\nfrom fava.application import app as application from fava.application import load_file application.config[\u0026#39;BEANCOUNT_FILE\u0026#39;] = \u0026#39;/home/USER/money.beancount\u0026#39; load_file() Save it and go back to the webapp page. Add a user and password at the bottom, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend NOT your pythonanywhere user/password and something long and unique, preferably generated and saved in a password manager like KeePassX. Now we need to install fava, to do this we\u0026rsquo;re going to use a script that\u0026rsquo;ll also be used for updating fava automatically.\nFava Installation # Again, inspired by the fava demo site lets set it up so new updates are automatically installed.\nFrom the dashboard, go to consoles and start a Bash console.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s pull a copy of the code, this isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary but might be useful in the future.\ngit clone https://github.com/aumayr/fava.git If you want to change the default settings, copy the config file to your home directory and update the wsgi above. The web server will then reference this. I\u0026rsquo;ve not found the need to change anything, but perhaps changing the theme might be one you do.\ncp ~/fava/fava/default-settings.conf ~ You could always just pull the file directly from github if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to clone the whole project:\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aumayr/fava/master/fava/default-settings.conf If you use a settings file make sure you update the wsgi file above to reference it.\nNow we need to make the update script:\nnano update.sh Add this code to it, ensuring you change the USER name.\n#!/bin/bash # Add user bin export PATH=$PATH:/home/USER/.local/bin # Upgrade fava pip3 install --user --upgrade beancount-fava # Reload web page touch /var/www/USER_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py Make it executable and run it.\nchmod +x update.sh ./update.sh Your site should now be working, but we don\u0026rsquo;t have a beancount file there. To test it out you could just manually upload your file from the Files tab, along with any include files.\nGo to https://USER.pythonanywhere.com, enter your username and password and there\u0026rsquo;s your beancount data on the web! If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work try reloading from the Web config page. If it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, check all your files and variable names.\npythonanywhere does support SSL (https) but doesn\u0026rsquo;t auto re-write so make sure you enter it into your browser.\nAutomagicness # To get fava to update automatically we simple go to the Schedule tab in the pythonanywhere dashboard and add a time and link to the update script, /home/USER/update.sh. If you find you run out of CPU usage, disable this and just do it manually every so often. I\u0026rsquo;d suggest setting the time to 23:55, so that way it runs and then your CPU limit gets reset at midnight.\nNow to automatically get your beancount file. I\u0026rsquo;m going to assume you don\u0026rsquo;t want to pay for pythonanywhere - as great as it is! I bring this up as it limits what methods you can push files to your account. SSH/rsync in or out of your account only work for paid accounts. If you do pay then you can setup a cron task on your home computer to push the file to your pythonanywhere account.\nRsync (paid only) # I find having ssh config setup is useful to make rsync and ssh easier\ncat ~/.ssh/config Host pyanyw HostName ssh.pythonanywhere.com port 12345 User your_pythonanywhere_user IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_SERVER1 Then add to your crontab with whatever frequency you\u0026rsquo;d like e.g. once a day at 4 am:\n0 4 * * * rsync -avzhP -e ssh /file/path/on/home/beancount.file \u0026#34;pyanyw:/home/USER/beancount.file\u0026#34; Auto sync # Two methods I\u0026rsquo;ve thought for this:\nDropbox. Turns out this won\u0026rsquo;t work on pythonanywhere, looks like they tried but couldn\u0026rsquo;t get it working. I use it as part of the rest of the whole finance system so would\u0026rsquo;ve been nice to use it here. I left dropbox as an option in to point this out in case you were wondering.\nGit / version control server This is a great way as you have version control and can add a pull command in the update script. If you want to make changes on the server and push back, you\u0026rsquo;d have to log into pythonanywhere and start a console to make a commit though. Gitlab does free private repos, and since writing this post originally I\u0026rsquo;ve now setup a private gitlab repo.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s two things you need to setup to use your gitlab repo automatically:\nSSH keys # Actually this isn\u0026rsquo;t needed if you only ever intend on pulling from gitlab. This is just so you can git push without needing your password.\nThis allows passwordless access to your repo, essential if you want to automate it. It\u0026rsquo;s best to make a new key, something like id_gitlab.\nOpen a bash console on pytonanywhere:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -C \u0026#34;$your_email\u0026#34; Then add this key to the \u0026lsquo;My SSH Keys\u0026rsquo; section under the \u0026lsquo;SSH\u0026rsquo; tab in your user profile. Output it to the terminal with cat:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_gitlab.pub Make sure it\u0026rsquo;s the .pub one!\nNow we need to make pythonanywhere know of this key in a ssh config file.\ncat ~/.ssh/config Host gitlab.com RSAAuthentication yes IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_gitlab User mygitlabusername Update our update.sh script # Change the script to:\n#!/bin/bash # Update beancount file git -C money/ pull # Add user bin export PATH=$PATH:/home/alexjj/.local/bin # Update fava pip3 install --user --upgrade beancount-fava # Reload web page touch /var/www/alexjj_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py Now clone your gitlab repo, and update the update.sh and wsgi scripts to match your location. Restart the web server and now everything should be automatically updated and pulled daily!\nJust to note that if you edit the beancount file in fava and save it, the git pull won\u0026rsquo;t work as you\u0026rsquo;ll have uncommitted changed. So either commit the changes, or revert them. I\u0026rsquo;m considering setting up something to make it easier to commit changes, but I find I rarely want to add anything on fava as it involves too much typing compared to editing in spacemacs.\nFinishing touches # Now you have the awesome fava tool to query, graph and analyse your data accessible from anywhere. If you have your own domain you can add a forwarding rule and point it at https://USER.pythonanywhere.com so you can go to myawesomemoneysite.com and there\u0026rsquo;s your data.\nI\u0026rsquo;d suggest subscribing to the mailing lists, or at least favouriting them on google groups, join the irc channels and trying it all yourself.\nLet me know if you have set this up and any improvements you\u0026rsquo;ve made!\n","date":"27 February 2016","permalink":"/posts/2016/managing-my-personal-finances-with-beancount/","section":"Posts","summary":"Explaining my setup with beancount, fava, and pythonanywhere","title":"Managing my personal finances with beancount"},{"content":" TLR Action 👋 Hello, I\u0026rsquo;m Alex Johnstone. # Often found online as alexjj. I chose alexjj handle when trying to find a gmail account back when you had to be invited to it (~2003?) and this was the shortest, simplest and accurate to my name as I could come up with. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to keep it across all platforms, although I\u0026rsquo;ve been slow or didn\u0026rsquo;t care about some sites and so missed out on it. alexjj on twitter was gone when I first signed up. I quit twitter, but then later made another account and saw that I\u0026rsquo;d missed the opportunity to get it. Oh well.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been making websites since around 2000, and this is the umpteenth variation of this site. Around 10-11 years ago I first registered this domain and it originally started out as a tumblr blog. It jumped around a little and then ended up as a static blog. I went through a few different ones, all the time spending ages setting up a blog with a nice new theme, but rarely writing anything whatsoever.\nMore recently I tried using Wordpress, and that was very enjoyable for writing in. Especially including pictures. Everything is just drag and drop. It\u0026rsquo;s very nice. I\u0026rsquo;d not used Wordpress in years and years and it really is a nice experience. However, my underlying dislike for unnecessary databases, and straying from plain text (or plain HTML) makes me keep looking for something else. I really like Tiddlywiki and have used it for a long time as a wiki site. I also tried using it for this site, but it\u0026rsquo;s a little quirky and I think I want something more \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo;. Static sites are my favourite but for now I\u0026rsquo;m trying out blot.im for this site. It\u0026rsquo;s like a static site for lazy people 😅.\nI like lots of things, I tend to try and do a lot of stuff but not often for a long time. Having said that, photography has been something that has stayed since I really got started with it around 2010. In addition to photography, I like to describe myself as a computer science hobbyist. This means I like lots to do with computers - whether that\u0026rsquo;s programming, hardware, building stuff, using and trying different software, running different operating systems, the internet and all it entails (although not really any social media) and generally spending time on a computer.\nContrary to this, I do like time away from a computer. Reading fiction, writing in notebooks, typing on a typewriter, and being outside. I do think I spend too much time on a computer but it\u0026rsquo;s a habit that\u0026rsquo;s hard to break. It\u0026rsquo;s likely this site will end up reflecting what I like and what I spend my time doing.\nSundries # Books I\u0026rsquo;ve read Hydrocarbon Processing Publication ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/about/","section":"Welcome to my site","summary":"TLR Action 👋 Hello, I\u0026rsquo;m Alex Johnstone.","title":"About me"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"}]
