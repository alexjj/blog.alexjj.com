There's a website, [onetypedpage.com](https://onetypedpage.com/), which is just that. Each day people submit a photo of their typed page and it gets hosted on this blog. I've known about it for a long time but only recently started going back to it. There appears to be some comments about moderation and conflict, but as far as I ever saw it was a quiet enjoyable site to read through with a cup of tea.
