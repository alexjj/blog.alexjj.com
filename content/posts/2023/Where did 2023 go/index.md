Here we are, the evening of the last day of the year and I wonder what did happen? I also wonder what will come next year? This time last year I did make a list in [dynalist](https://dynalist.io/) of what I wanted to do in 2023, and I thought I should probably look back on it before I (blindly) make 2024's list. I also decided to rank myself red, yellow, green on what I achieved. Doesn't seem like it's been that great, with five red, four yellow and only one green. I also have one blue.

Let's start with the good and work down. The only one I gave myself a green was for journaling. This consists of the family journal in DayOne, my idle chatter blog, and this site. I wasn't perfect by any means, and I'm only 140 DayOne entries for this year, which is about 40% of the year. However, the weblogs were reasonable. I think a good target for 2024 would be 50% of the year but otherwise continue has I've been. I do have a few draft posts for this site I've yet to write, so maybe something more specific for next year, like 1 post per month, would be a good target.

On to the yellows. The four in this category are sleeping, reading, working and spending. Where the objective was to do more, more, smarter, and less respectively. I'm more of a night person, but with young kids I'm always awake at 6-6:30am every day, so if I go to bed by 10pm and read, I'm usually okay. It's the nights where it's 11 or later that I go to bed and then by the time I fall asleep it could be midnight or later. I usually feel pretty poor the next day. I scored myself yellow as sometimes I'm good but other times I'm very bad. Reading follows sleeping in that most of my reading is done before I go to bed, but if I stay up too late too often then I'm too tired to read. The area I'm lacking for reading is with some of the non-fiction books I have. Many are sat on the shelf and have been for several years, and I wanted to read them. I don't, however, want to read them in the evening when I'm going to bed as I won't remember them and I also want to take a few notes from them. I'd just never pick sitting and reading a book in the evening vs. all the other things I want to do.

Working is all about being more organised, tracking actions, managing notes, spending less time "multitasking", checking emails etc., and get more things done. This is mixed and I know I have areas to improve.

The final yellow is about buying less stuff. I've got a bit addicted to looking at hotukdeals, and it has probably led to buying more things - although great deals! One thing that hasn't helped, is taking up amateur radio. This has led to buying more things, which I wouldn't have, but it's a fun hobby so I just need to keep it sensible. Definetly seen the impact of inflation this year, and not spent the time to work out the summary of this year's spending...hopefully it's less than what we earnt!

Now to the reds.
