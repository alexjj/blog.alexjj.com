<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Scotland’s government has decided that from next year (from a tax perspective) they’ll be adding <em>another</em> tax band to Scotland. A 45 per cent income tax band for earnings between £75,000 and £125,140. Plus fiddling with the ranges and percentages of the other bands.</p>
<p>So from the 6th April 2024 these will be the rates:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Bands</strong></th>
<th><strong>Band name</strong></th>
<th><strong>Rate</strong></th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>£12,571 - £14,876</td>

<td>19%</td>

<tr class="even">

<td>Basic</td>
<td>20%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>£26,562 - £43,662</td>
<td>Intermediate</td>
<td>21%</td>

<tr class="even">
<td>£43,663 - £74,999</td>

<td>42%</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>£75,000 - £125,140</td>
<td>Advanced</td>
<td>45%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Above £125,140</td>
<td>Top</td>
<td>48%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The current ones are:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Bands</strong></th>
<th><strong>Band name</strong></th>
<th><strong>Rate</strong></th>

<tr class="odd">

<tr class="even">

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The personal allowance (0%) remains the same at £12,570 (regardless of inflation, <strong>cough</strong> stealth tax <strong>cough</strong>) and the reduction of this between £100,000 to £125,140 by £1 for every £2.</p>
<p>I’m in the process of making myself a financial forecasting tool to figure out how much I should split between my ISA and pension, in the naive attempt to be financially independent by the time I’m 50. The first part of that was making a function to calculate income tax, and whilst I was making it, I thought it might be interesting to see how these income tax changes impact everyone’s salary, from £0 to £200k.</p>
<p>For the record, here’s England’s tax bands:</p>
<table class="table">

<tr class="header">

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-code">The Code</h2>
<p>The personal allowance is a funny thing, and took me a while to figure out how to calculate it correctly. Working this out is not a new problem so I looked on Github and it seemed people either did a whole load of <code>if</code> statements or some clever but unintelligible (by me at least) <a href="https://github.com/HJEGeorge/tax_calculator/blob/master/tax_tools.py#L178">numpy matrix math</a>.</p>
<p>The best way I found to understand it and calculate it such that I could pass various bands and percentages, was to remove the personal allowance from your income and the tax bands that were under £100k, in something that looks like this:</p>

<p>My function takes a list of the bands and percentages. As I couldn’t think of another way to do it whilst keeping it simple I just add a trillion pounds to the upper end of the bands. A trillion isn’t entirely necessary, but I figured it should cover most of the population.</p>

<p>Obviously above £75k it has changed, but actually at the lower amounts it has changed too. Generally, slightly better as the band ranges have changed. Although if you earn £15k a year, I’m not sure how much you’ll notice the £1.44 extra, given the double digit inflation and Brexit consequences.</p>
<p>Check out that steep gradient between £100k and £125k, the loss of the personal allowance makes it a very high marginal rate of tax.</p>
<p>Let’s just have a look at the change between them to make it more obvious.</p>

  <title>Where did 2023 go?</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Here we are, the evening of the last day of the year (at least when I started writing this, took me a few more days to finish!) and I wonder what did happen? I also wonder what will come next year? This time last year I did make a list in <a href="https://dynalist.io/">dynalist</a> of what I wanted to do in 2023, and I thought I should probably look back on it before I (blindly) make 2024’s list. I also decided to rank myself red, yellow, green on what I achieved. Doesn’t seem like it’s been that great, with five red, four yellow and only one green. I also have one blue.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the good and work down. The only one I gave myself a green was for journaling. This consists of the family journal in DayOne, my idle chatter blog, and this site. I wasn’t perfect by any means, and I’m only 140 DayOne entries for this year, which is about 40% of the year. However, the weblogs were reasonable. I think a good target for 2024 would be 50% of the year but otherwise continue has I’ve been. I do have a few draft posts for this site I’ve yet to write, so maybe something more specific for next year, like 1 post per month, would be a good target.</p>
<p>On to the yellows. The four in this category are sleeping, reading, working and spending. Where the objective was to do more, more, smarter, and less respectively. I’m more of a night person, but with young kids I’m always awake at 6-6:30am every day, so if I go to bed by 10pm and read, I’m usually okay. It’s the nights where it’s 11 or later that I go to bed and then by the time I fall asleep it could be midnight or later. I usually feel pretty poor the next day. I scored myself yellow as sometimes I’m good but other times I’m very bad. Reading follows sleeping in that most of my reading is done before I go to bed, but if I stay up too late too often then I’m too tired to read. The area I’m lacking for reading is with some of the non-fiction books I have. Many are sat on the shelf and have been for several years, and I wanted to read them. I don’t, however, want to read them in the evening when I’m going to bed as I won’t remember them and I also want to take a few notes from them. I’d just never pick sitting and reading a book in the evening vs.&nbsp;all the other things I want to do.</p>
<p>Working is all about being more organised, tracking actions, managing notes, spending less time “multitasking”, checking emails etc., and get more things done. This is mixed and I know I have areas to improve.</p>
<p>The final yellow is about buying less stuff. I’ve got a bit addicted to looking at hotukdeals, and it has probably led to buying more things - although great deals! One thing that hasn’t helped, is taking up amateur radio. This has led to buying more things, which I wouldn’t have, but it’s a fun hobby so I just need to keep it sensible. Definetly seen the impact of inflation this year, and not spent the time to work out the summary of this year’s spending…hopefully it’s less than what we earnt!</p>
<p>Now to the reds. 🚨</p>
<p>First up, is exercise more. In my defence I cycle to work each day, so I don’t do nothing, but I bought a rowing machine in 2022 and haven’t used it in about 16 months, and I told myself I’d use it this year. Laughably, I set my target as three times a week.</p>
<p>I wanted to print more photos and to write more letters to people, ideally combining both and potentially using the typewriter. Did a pretty poor job of those.</p>
<p>Now these two are funny ones, on one hand I wanted to spend less time on the computer but on the other I wanted to play more computer games. What I really meant was spend less time on the computer <em>doing nothing</em>. e.g.&nbsp;browsing the web, looking at hotukdeals, watching youtube, researching things I’ll never do, etc. I knew it would be hard to break the habit of sitting down on the computer and so I thought a good counter to that would be to actually play some computer games. I like playing computer games too. They often have good stories or challenging puzzles to figure out, and I enjoy playing multiplayer with my friends as we chat whilst playing them. Also, I have so many games that I’ve bought over the years but never played…thank you Steam sales.</p>
<p>Finally, I gave myself a blue badge. This was for my “projects” section, which originally had ideas for various websites, or uses for all these SBCs and accessories that seem to be lying around. I didn’t actually do any of them, however, as I ended up getting my amateur radio licence I built a lot of things related to that. So I did some projects - quite significant ones for me - but none of the original list. This didn’t fit with how I categorised green and yellow so blue it is.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve looked back, let’s turn around and look forward and try and learn from what happened. Easy said than done.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>There’s a website, <a href="https://onetypedpage.com/">onetypedpage.com</a>, which is just that. Each day people submit a photo of their typed page and it gets hosted on this blog. I’ve known about it for a long time but only recently started going back to it. There appears to be some comments about moderation and conflict, but as far as I ever saw it was a quiet enjoyable site to read through with a cup of tea.</p>

  <title>Subscriptions</title>

  <link>https://alexjj.com/posts/2023/Subscriptions/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Seen a few <a href="https://baty.net/2023/11/subscriptions-2/">posts</a> recently with people listing their subs. Thought I’d join in.</p>
<p>I really don’t like subscriptions, and would much rather pay once and be done with it. Once you join and commit, they have you, it can be hard to leave. The upside is that if you don’t like it, it’s minimal expense to stop. Photoshop used to be hundreds of pounds but now it’s just ten. Of course in those days, 30 day demos or similar were common. Anyway here goes (Monthly prices):</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Prime - £95 per year (£7.92 per month)</li>
<li>Netflix - £16 increasing to £18. We have premium to get downloads on more than two devices.</li>
<li>TV licence - £13.25. Required to watch BBC, even via iPlayer. A weird one.</li>
<li>Spotify - £10.99. Currently just premium for my wife, but we have had the family one in the past.</li>
<li>Apple iCloud 50 GB - £0.99</li>
<li>HP instant ink - £4.49. This is for 100 pages a month. I could probably drop down a level, we had a brief patch of printing a lot but think that’s past. £2.99 gives 50 pages a month.</li>
<li>Domains - I’ve seem to have spent £75 (£6.25/m) this year on six domains. Can definitely cancel one and I should investigate transferring them elsewhere.</li>
<li>Liteserver VPS - €26.40 per year (£1.93 /m). A Black Friday deal. Might see what they have again this year and transfer if it’s cheaper. Although less hassle just to stay</li>
<li>MXRoute email hosting - $5 per year (£0.25/m). Another Black Friday deal from years and years ago. I just keep it as it couldn’t be matched again. Don’t even use it though…</li>
<li>Two SIM only phone contracts for us - £8/m each. Usually sign up for another deal each year to reset the price.</li>
<li>Tesco delivery saver - Currently about £0.20 per month but only as we used clubcard points to buy vouchers for this. It’s £29.94 for 6 months of offpeak delivery.</li>
<li>Amazon kids+ - £38 per year (£3.17/m). Did get last year on a promo for £20 but haven’t seen any recently. We have two Kindle fires which the kids play on and having access to everything is pretty good. They’ve got a lot of use out of it. If I can find another promo that would be good, although the annual fee just hit recently so maybe not much scope in the near term.</li>
</ul>
<p>Total: £83.44 per month</p>
<p>That includes netflix increase, which will put it at 22% of the total, with TV licence next.</p>
<p>Other subscription services we use but only when free, generally via promos:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple music</li>
<li>Apple TV</li>
<li>Disney+</li>
<li>Oracle free VPS</li>
</ul>
<p>I debate about getting Apple One for 2TB of storage, music, TV, and to some extent apps. The kindle fires are ancient, and were $20 refurbs from 2018, but still going. However, at some stage I suspect they’ll die and we probably won’t replace them, but rather we’ll have enough hand-me-down iPads to take their place. This plus the likeihood our eldest will get a phone next year means that the free apps might be useful. The 2 TB of storage would be nice to then backup all my photos into Photos.app and enjoy the benefit of that. TV is nice add-on, which I wouldn’t pay for separately. Music would be great if we could leave Spotify. We think Spotify is a better app to use, and works much better with streaming to our house speakers (powered by Google Chromecast audio). Better off paying for family spotify as I think everyone would rather have it. This just then makes Apple One not that worthwhile. If I want the photos back up then I should just pay the £7/m for the storage.</p>
<p>My wife does have yoga apps she subscribes to, not sure the current status of those but likely paid annually, and maybe there are some other annual things lurking that I’ve forgotten about.</p>
<p>So not too bad overall. I keep thinking about raising the subject of cancelling Netflix but it does get watched a lot by everyone.</p>

  <title>A new writing nook</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I have to admit my previous <a href="https://alexjj.com/posts/2022/a-little-writing-nook/">one</a> has become overwhelmed with things that there is no longer anywhere to write. It is now home to radio books and magazines, a few other books I keep meaning to read, a <a href="https://alexjj.com/posts/2022/hobonichi-first/">Hobonichi</a> I’ve yet to write in, and more. I keep meaning to tidy it up.</p>
<p>We recently inherited a nice bureau from my wife’s grandparents, and her mum kindly brought it up to our house. We also got various little knick-knacks, house items, recipe books and consumable things like notepads and sewing stuff. Still to find homes for it all but the first thing I wanted to test out was the bureau.</p>

<p>I’d actually forgotten it had drawers at the bottom, which is slightly disappointing as I can’t tuck a chair under it when not in use, but they are very handy for storing paper and notebooks etc. I even think I could store the Olivetti in one. That would be ideal. Even though I like having the typewriter out in the office on the desk, it does take up a lot of space.</p>
<p>By far the most exciting part is all those cubbies for trinkets and mysteries! My nanna used to have a bureau in her house, and as a child I remember finding it open some days and just poking about in all the little sections. There were so many things packed into it. It also contained all her correspondence and home admin, just nothing was organised, at least not how any of us could see. It was in the dining room, and so when it was dinner time she could just close it up and everything looked tidy, even though behind that door was a mess of papers and objects.</p>
<p>Hopefully we’ll keep ours a little tidier than that!</p>

</div>
<p>The office refurb we did was, and still is, great. There is so much desk space available for all sorts of things at the same time. However, it’s where the computer sits and boy is it hard for me to sit down in the office and NOT go on the computer. It really takes a lot of effort to write with a pen or the typewriter and I’ve essentially done none in a long time. Amateur radio has also been a big cause of doing nothing else but amateur radio, but even before that I was doing very little. My best periods of writing where when we were on holiday this summer, where I wrote everyday. There, I’m out of my routine and there’s no autopilot sit on the computer.</p>
<p>Now with this new writing nook, away from the computer, my intent is that I will reestablish my routine. The only issue is that it’s in the hallway, and so everyone will hear the typewriter, but that’s a minor detail I can work around…probably by getting everyone some ear plugs for christmas.</p>

<p>Several years ago, when we were living in California, I started thinking about getting my amateur radio licence. I don’t remember why I started on this, but it seemed like something I’d enjoy and be interested in. I didn’t end up doing anything, as you had to sit exams at test centres and it wasn’t convenient. I soon forgot about it and did nothing more. Last summer, the same thoughts occurred to me again, not sure why, but I started looking into radio. This time what it takes to be licenced in the UK.</p>
<p>All that resulted in passing my foundation licence in December 2022 in the online exams by the <a href="https://rsgb.org/">RSGB</a>. I’d spoken to a friend about it in the summer, and he got interested. We both did the Essexham foundation training course, which runs online for a few weeks. He ended up passing first, which encouraged me to get on with booking my exam.</p>
<p>The content isn’t difficult, but there’s a lot of specific things you just need to remember. The exams “don’t have trick questions” but often have word games or a particular way of asking questions which can make them harder than you’d think. I probably should’ve read the foundation manual as well.</p>
<p>It took until January before I actually got my licene from ofcom, the postal strikes and christmas holidays meant it took a while. I then got to pick my callsign online. There weren’t many options to pick from and so ended up with something that, to me, sounded reasonable - MM7RVP. My callsign is M7RVP, but being in Scotland means I have to put in the other M. People in England don’t have to use any letters (except for intermediate licence), which is a little annoying but I suppose the UK couldn’t have too many designated letters.</p>
<p>I then did nothing for 4 months. Well, not nothing but I didn’t use my callsign on the air. I mostly debated what I wanted to buy - if anything. Radio transceivers (transmitters and receivers in one) aren’t that cheap. Probably not a high volume electronics item like computers and TVs, so are still pricey. Used gear is cheaper but after the initial depreciation, they then to hold their prices well. My friend and I were in the same boat, what do we get, is it worth it etc. He did buy a VHF/UHF setup, which is good for local contacts, but what’s the most fun is HF. HF is the frequency range (3-30 MHz) that can go all around the world in the ionosphere.</p>
<p>Like most electronic things, there is no one perfect device. Perhaps the £10,000 one could be classed as that, but it’s £10k and therefore not perfect 😅. We both had a similar shortlist of radios and spent many evenings debating the trade offs of them.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption>My first radio: Xiegu G90</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>One day I saw one on the UK’s used <a href="https://www.hamradiodeals.co.uk/">ham radio forum</a>, and that sold it for me. It was in great condition and I could easily sell it for what I paid for it, £350, if I needed to. I bought a Xiegu G90. This is a chinese brand radio, has a small but usable screen with a waterfall and does 20W on the HF bands. My foundation licence only allows 10W so it’s ideal. I was all sorted. Well…with a radio, I still needed an antenna.</p>
<p>Picking a radio is very easy in comparison to picking an antenna. I think you never really pick one, you just make one, try it, and then make more and try them. Maybe you find some are better than others, or maybe they’re just different. I don’t know yet, as I’ve only had one so far but picking that was tricky.</p>
<p>There are so many factors in picking an antenna, and it really depends on the space you have and what you’re willing to do. My aim was easy to install and would be decent enough to get me going.</p>
<p>To cut a long story short, I went with what’s called an end fed half wave (EFHW) antenna, for the 40m band and up, making it 20m of wire. It works well on many bands, and the internal tuner on the Xiegu even gets a couple of others out of it.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption>Ready to put up the antenna</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Armed with a big mug of tea, I was ready to put up the antenna. I would attach to the balcony on the first floor, and to a pole at the end of the garden. Or so I planned. Turned out the pole I bought was quite weak and bendy.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">

<figcaption>A bit too bendy</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The pole is 6 m tall but with the flex, the antenna was only about 3-3.5m off the ground. (I later read it would be better to thread it through a loop on the pole and tie it off on the ground, so that the pole wasn’t taking the full horizontal force. I did try that, but it wasn’t much better.)</p>
<p>I thought I could raise it up by tying the pole to the nearby tree - this tree is unfortunately still quite small else I’d have used it in the first place.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="oops.JPG" class="lightbox" data-glightbox="description: .lightbox-desc-5" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-5" title="Oh Dear…"><img src="https://alexjj.com/posts/2023/amateur-radio/oops.JPG" title="Oh Dear..." class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Oh Dear…"></a></p>
<figcaption>Oh Dear…</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>A little too much force it seems…I took down the pole and ended up tying the antenna to the tree, whilst the tree is small it could still hold the weight of the line and I could get it moderately high. I ordered a space section, so the pole will be for a portable setup that I’ll make one day.</p>
<p>The antenna is about 4m off the ground at the house end and almost 3 at the tree end. Not the greatest but will do. The closer it is to the ground the more signal is absorbed by the ground and the higher the remaining signal gets sent into the air. This isn’t great for long distance as a lot of the signal will get lost or only do one bounce in the atmosphere. However, to get it higher I’ll need some serious pole solution.</p>
<p>So how has it been? Pretty fun! I’ve spoken to people all over Europe, into Canada and the USA. I can often hear signals from all around the world - Falklands, Australia, Japan, Indonesia, South Africa, etc. - but they can’t hear me.</p>

<p>I’ve used the digital mode, FT8, which means I connect my computer to the radio and it communicates with other computers via radio. This doesn’t need nearly as much signal compared to noise to make a contact compared to voice contacts. The best part is that you can look up online (on <a href="https://pskreporter.info/">PSK Reporter</a>) who has heard your signal. So you don’t need to make a contact with them to know how far your signal has gone. I’ve been heard across the world with this, and have made real contacts with Australia, Brazil and Japan.</p>

<p>Digital is nice to do whilst doing something else on the computer, and it is fun when you see someone far away has heard you, but by far the most fun is talking to people. Sometimes it’s a quick signal report and move on, and other times we get into chats about gear (most often) and local things going on. Often I’ll listen to others chatting and enjoy that just as much. Each evening you go on, you never know who’s going to be there and who’s going to hear you (the signal propagation relies on solar activity and is different each day on each band). I could (and have!) spend hours on the radio. So much so that I’ve not had time to do anything else - no photography, no blog posts, not finished the mac mini G3 build, and probably plenty of other things.</p>
<p>I did manage to tear myself away from the radio to study for the intermediate licence - this is the next level in the UK system and lets me use 50W and a few more bands. I passed this a few weeks ago, and so have a new callsign, 2M0RVM. It takes a while to get used to saying the new sign and sometimes I mix up the old and new, especially the RVP vs RVM. Maybe I should’ve picked something completely different but I liked the sound of RVM, and finding a free one is tricky, there isn’t an up to date list anywhere (even the last freedom of information request list from January 2023 was significantly out of date).</p>
<p>Now I’m debating the antenna situation. Pole or not, a vertical, something else. My wife isn’t keen on the wire going across the garden but equally doesn’t like the sound of a 10m pole! I have started to look into satellites too, at least a dish is more discrete. I’m also thinking of setting up a portable antenna for trips away.</p>
<p>Plus I have the full licence still to get. 📚 (Update July 2023: I’m now a full holder!)</p>

<p>Book cases, book shelves, whatever you call them, I am drawn towards them. It is always interesting to see what people put on theirs. Both the books and also the trinkets or sundries. It’s such a big collection of stories, both contained within the book but of the person that owns them. What is the journey that this book has come along to get to this shelf? What did the reader think when they got the book, when (if) they read it? Where is the book going next?</p>
<p>If you’re lucky you have space, and shelves and books to together, and then you get to choose what goes on them, and where in the house these books should live. You get to pick the order in which they’re stacked on the shelf.</p>
<p>Or maybe these decisions have never been made, and just the natural flow of life has resulted in books on shelves with the same choosing that results in driftwood on a beach.</p>

<p>Some books have obvious places to live. Kids books in or near kids rooms for bedtime stories, or for them to hide away from the world and enjoy the quiet company of a book.</p>
<p>Recipe books in the kitchen. Some carefully written down instructions past down through the family, some old favourites of chefs long retired, some modern and cool but totally impractical for busy family life.</p>

<p>I have a lot of ebooks too. These are very convenient to take with me on holiday and great for reading at night in bed. I can read for hours in the dark with my backlit ebook reader and no-one else is disturbed. But no-one else will really read those books unless I actively tell them or they come asking. These books are hidden away, never to provide entertainment for a curious passerby.</p>

  <title>First attempts with 4x5</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>
  <link>https://alexjj.com/posts/2023/first-attempts-at-4x5/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I’ve been meaning to write this up for the last 14 months! I also took a lot more photos for this post but I don’t seem to be able to find any…🤷</p>
<p>A while back, in 2021, I was making a <a href="https://wiki.alexjj.com/#LargeFormat">wiki note</a> on large format cameras, specifically 4x5 cameras. Jack noticed this and asked me if I would be interested in his <a href="https://wiki.baty.net/#Burke%20&amp;%20James%20Press%20Camera">B&amp;J Press camera</a>. Very generous of him! Postage to the UK wasn’t the cheapest, but it was still far cheaper than trying to find anything here.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="bandjpress-thumb.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" data-glightbox="description: .lightbox-desc-1" title="Burke and James Press Camera"><img src="https://alexjj.com/posts/2023/first-attempts-at-4x5/bandjpress-thumb.jpg" title="Burke and James Press Camera" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Burke and James Press Camera"></a></p>
<figcaption>Burke and James Press Camera</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This is a 4x5 camera, meaning it takes 4x5” film. It just uses one sheet at a time and it is a VERY manual process! With so many steps from what you see to a photo, that if you get it right the sense of accomplishment is beyond words.</p>
<p>It took me a few months before I mustered up everything I needed, plus the commitment to actually use it. I got a box of Fomapan 400 sheets, loaded them into the film backs in my dark bag and proceeded to try and take a picture of <em>something</em>.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">

<figcaption>Camera on tripod</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I took it into the back garden and took some (two) photos of the house and then of the kids. Amazingly they stood still long enough for me to faff about and take the shot.</p>
<p>Up to this point, whilst I had been taking film photos, I’d never developed anything myself and had just been sending off the film to labs. Now with 4x5 this is a lot harder as it’s great big sheets that you can’t expose to the light. I’d have to post off the whole holder, and that did not seem very reliable, plus the cost was tremendous. So as well as doing my first 4x5, I was also doing my first home development…in trays!</p>
<p>I set it all up in the bathroom in the spare room, it has no windows and I thought it would be a good location. All the trays were filled and I was ready to develop. It’s quite strange (and very uncomfortable) sitting on the floor for 20 minutes whilst trying to develop these sheets. I also realised that, after adjusting the the darkness for 20 minutes, that the room wasn’t as dark as I thought it was. Oh well.</p>
<p>By some miracle of beginners luck I did manage to make a photo!</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><a href="first-4x5.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-3" data-glightbox="description: .lightbox-desc-3" title="Kids black and white photo"><img src="https://alexjj.com/posts/2023/first-attempts-at-4x5/first-4x5.jpg" title="That vintage look" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Kids black and white photo"></a></p>
<figcaption>Kids black and white photo</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Technically, it is absolutely terrible, and look at all those scratches and uneven developing marks. However, I love it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it would end up being the only successful photo I’ve managed to make with the B&amp;J. I tried it again and everything was black. Somewhere, something is leaking light and I’d need to do a lot of investigating to figure out exactly what is the problem. Is the film I bought sealed from the light? Is it the film holder? Is it the camera? Did I develop it correctly? And maybe some others. I did buy a special developing tank for the 4x5 to make it less painful to develop.</p>
<p>So for the past 14 months, the B&amp;J has made a nice shelf decoration with my camera things. I enjoyed using it, and I’d like to do it again, but maybe when I have more time. It’s definitely one for the retired/kids have left home timeframe!</p>

  <title>My 2022 Steam Replay</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>
  <link>https://alexjj.com/posts/2022/my-steam-replay/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Annual recaps seem to be the trend in social media and apps. It’s quite interesting actually. Reddit did one, which told me the scary number of hours I’ve spent on the app. Including spending 25 hours on /r/leica 🤫</p>
<p>Steam now do one and shows me how much time I spend on games. I knew I didn’t play that much but I was surprised by how little I did actually play!</p>
<p><a href="steam-replay.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1"><img src="https://alexjj.com/posts/2022/my-steam-replay/steam-replay.png" title="Doesn't actually compute time" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>I played Black Mesa, the Half-Life 1 remake in the HL2 engine, in March this year for just shy of 20 hours. My friend and I played Grim Dawn, think Diablo 2, in August and September for about 15 hours. We also played Streets of Rage 4, a remake of the Sega classics from the 90s. This was a disappointingly short game at 3.6 hours. It was fun but I’m sure the originals were much longer. That, or we just used to play them endlessly as penniless kids.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to play Horizon Zero Dawn a couple of times. Not sure why I’ve not got into it properly. It’s a nice RPG story game, but seems to have a unique storyline which looks interesting. It’s quite old now, and so often goes on sale. I picked it up at the start of the year but didn’t properly play it until June (if you count 3 hours as properly). I think that was a bit before our summer holidays and so when I came back I’d forgotten the controls and what was happening so didn’t continue. Then the longer I left it the harder it was to restart. I’ve been thinking about it recently but yet to start.</p>
<p><a href="annual.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-2"><img src="https://alexjj.com/posts/2022/my-steam-replay/annual.png" title="Not much since March" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>I actually want to play more games in 2023. I enjoy playing them and it’s a good way to relax if I’m tired from work. Feels like a better use of time than randomly browsing the internet, or spending another 25 hours on certain subreddits!</p>
<p>To finish the year, I’ve been playing Dwarf Fortress. I’ve been playing this game for years…I don’t remember exactly when I found it, but I think around 2011. It’s been free forever on their <a href="https://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">website</a>, but they just released a version on Steam this month. It has a new UI and a little bit more approachable. I’ve you’ve not heard of it then you’re missing out on some internet game lore. It’s a game made by two brothers that they started in 2002. They have been making this game as their full time job since then (or maybe about 2006) and living off donations. It is a simulation game and is detailed beyond anything ever. At the same time the original graphics are just ASCII characters. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Fortress">Wikipedia</a> can do a better job of explaining it than me.</p>
<p>I bought the Steam version, partly to support them and partly because it has a new UI. With christmas and everything I’ve not played much, about 8 hours, but it’s one I plan to continue into the new year.</p>

  <title>Choosing between the Fuji 50mm f/2 and the 60mm f/2.4</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>
  <link>https://alexjj.com/posts/2022/fuji-50-or-60/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This post sat as a draft for a long time when I was using blot. Whilst migrating my site to this new Hugo one I saw the pictures I took and thought I might as well write it up quickly.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="fuji-50-60-thumb.jpg" class="lightbox" data-glightbox="description: .lightbox-desc-1" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Two fuji lenses"><img src="https://alexjj.com/posts/2022/fuji-50-or-60/fuji-50-60-thumb.jpg" title="Side by side" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Two fuji lenses"></a></p>
<figcaption>Two fuji lenses</figcaption>

<section id="background" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I ended up with both the 50mm f/2 and the 60mm f/2.4. The first as I wanted a longer lens for when out and about, but still light and quick focusing, and the latter as I started scanning my film with my camera. One day I decided that having both was unnecessary and I went about deciding which one to get rid of.</p>
</section>
<section id="comparison" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="comparison">Comparison</h2>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption>Two lenses with hoods</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>They’re both similar in size and weight, except when you put the massive metal hood on the 60 mm, which adds another 70g, 30% weight of the lens itself! The 60mm must flare badly if it has such a stonking great hood. Does mean you don’t always need to carry it with you.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexjj.com/posts/2022/fuji-50-or-60/fuji-50-60-3.jpg" title="Lightweight 50mm" class="img-fluid" alt="50mm on scales"> <img src="https://alexjj.com/posts/2022/fuji-50-or-60/fuji-50-60-4.jpg" title="That hood" class="img-fluid" alt="60mm on scales"></p>
<p>Being 60mm, you do get more subject separation than the 50mm, even with the fraction slower speed. So for portraits - where people are standing still - the 60mm is probably better. It’s also of the old, original set of Fuji lenses (along with the <a href="../../../2022/new-fuji-lens/">35mm f/1.4</a> and the 56 f/1.2), which means it has a slightly different look than the modern ones. Good or bad? That’s personal preference. I certainly like the 35mm one.</p>
<p>f/2.4 vs f/2 is not really much different, although I’ve not done sharpness tests etc., for that you’ll have to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>The obvious difference is that the 60mm has close focus for macro - this was the very reason I bought it. I’m not sure 60mm is a great macro length and it’s not a perfect 1:1 macro, so YMMV. I’m thinking about replacing mine as for film scanning I can’t make use of the full sensor area with this lens, so seems like a waste.</p>
<p>Speaking of focusing…oh my, how the 60mm is slow compared to the 50mm. It’s not super slow, and perfectly usable even for kids running around but it’s not the 🫰 and you’re there focus of the 50mm. Having said that, the 50mm often missed focus on kids running around so not perfect either.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I sold the 50mm and kept the 60mm. I need the macro (unless I change my mind on the camera scanning solution) and I don’t often like shooting at longer lengths and I rarely/never do portrait sessions, so the 50mm doesn’t make much sense. Plus if I did do portraits, I could use the 60mm and it would be fine.</p>
<p>I actually have the 60mm for sale, with the intent to replace it with a better macro. There are various 3rd party manual focus macros which are much better and would be ideal for film scanning. Although I’m also tempted to abandon film scanning with my camera and just buy a dedicated 35mm scanner like the Plusteks. I used to own one but sold it and now I regret that. Whilst they’re slow to scan, everything is right there and easy to do. If the 60mm ever sells then I’ll decide what I’ll do.</p>

<p>Print out your photos. Please remind me to do this. It’s so fun to hold them in your hand and look at them. You really study them when they’re there and it’s not a queue of 200 images to get through.</p>
<p>Doesn’t need to be a fancy printer, or perfectly colour matched. Just print them out on whatever you have. Don’t have a printer? <a href="https://www.canon.co.uk/printers/selphy-compact-photo-printers/">Get one of these</a> for immediate fun! Although a little pricier than a regular printer per photo. Or take advantage of the numerous offers online to print a bunch of 4x6s.</p>

  <title>Film scanning with my digital camera</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>
  <link>https://alexjj.com/posts/2022/film-scanning-with-camera/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>A few weeks ago I managed my first successful attempt at film development. Whilst I was very excited that it worked, the next thing was actually seeing the images. I did take a tiny picture of several frames using my phone and the filmdev app. That was fun just to see that there was something.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="quick-scan.jpg" class="lightbox" data-glightbox="description: .lightbox-desc-1" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Quick scan with phone"><img src="https://alexjj.com/posts/2022/film-scanning-with-camera/quick-scan.jpg" title="Quick scan with phone" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Quick scan with phone"></a></p>
<figcaption>Quick scan with phone</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The next thing is making larger images. My two choices were scanning onto the computer or dark room printing. Unfortunately, I don’t have a darkroom (although I do want to somehow make one in the garage), so scanning it is. When I scanned my grandfather’s slides I used a dedicated 35mm/slide scanner. The Plustek 8200 or something, together with Silverfast AI. The scanner is slow, the software is very weird, but once you figured out the routine you could steadily work your way through them all. In my wisdom, I’d sold the Plustek after finishing the slides - actually made money on it, which when I then came to look at buying another realised that this is because the prices are going up, and still going up, for used models. Another option is a flatbed scanner, but those are quite expensive and sounded more annoying for 35mm.</p>
<p>The final option is using a digital camera. As I have a digital camera, this did seem the more sensible option. However, you do need quite a few other things to make it all work. Namely a tripod or stand, light source, macro lens, and something to hold the film/black out around it. Like all things you can spend a fortune on any one of these items. I tried not to but the macro lens was never going to be cheap. I went for the Fuji 60mm f/2.4 as I thought it would also be useful as a mid-range portrait lens. I’ve never used it for that but I still might. However, having used it for scanning I’m not sure I like it for that. I’ve found manual focus is more reliable and helps speed up the process once it’s dialled in and the 60mm’s focus by wire isn’t that great. Perhaps I’ll look to sell it and get a manual focus one - assuming it’s a net cost to me.</p>

<p>Back when I did my first development on 4x5, I tried a cheapo camera stand thing and a home made, black card mask. The mask was actually fine but the tripod stand thing was absolutely terrible. Wobbly and hard to adjust. It went straight back and I shelled out for a reasonable tripod. I had to find one that let me rotate the pole around so the camera can be mounted underneath. This is much more stable, secure and makes it easy to keep things parallel. For 35mm I think a home made mask might get tedious, so I went with an <a href="https://clifforth.co.uk/">essential film holder</a>. This gets lots of great reviews online, and as far as holders go it’s a cheap one - although still £75…</p>

<p>The fold out screen of the X-E4 is very handy for lining stuff up and changing settings. It flips the display when the screen moves past a certain angle which is ideal, it does mean the menu navigation is backwards but I can get used to that. I should make a preset for scanning so that I can get going quicker next time, as changing settings is a bit of a hassle as I then have to change them back later. I think I’ve messed up one of my presets so I’ll have to check that next time I’m using the camera. The macro lens isn’t quite long enough to get the film to completely fill the screen/sensor, extension tubes could fix that, or a longer lens. Maybe 80mm or 100mm? It’s not too big a deal as I just crop in post, which I’d do anyway. It also makes it quick to align as I’m not trying to hit it perfect straight away. Probably means my images are 12-14 megapixel vs.&nbsp;the cameras 26. Still plenty big enough.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time faffing about with trying to do tethered photos with Lightroom on the computer. Eventually realised that my copy of lightroom needs a paid for add-on to do it with Fuji. I then tried Fuji’s X Acquire but I couldn’t get it to work. The instructions said to put the camera in a certain mode, but my settings didn’t have that option, only for a webcam, so I don’t know. I also tried using the remote app on my phone but it was too slow and awkward for focusing. I was concerned about camera shake, but I just ended up using the 2 second delay to take the photos. This worked well, except it makes a really loud beeping sound which annoyed my wife in the other room whilst she was watching TV!</p>
<p>Just to add to it all, my battery was very low and all the fiddling around I’d been doing meant it died after a few shots.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption>The starting point</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Once I got the first image in focus with peaking and zooming it, I could quite quickly move between frames and capture the whole roll in not much time at all. I think with a scanning preset setup on the camera, next time should be very quick.</p>
<p>I then spent ages fighting with Lightroom again until I realised my copy, again, was too old and didn’t support my camera’s raw files. So that was the end of Lightroom. When I went to bed that night I realised I could use another program to convert the RAFs to DNGs and use Lightroom.</p>
<p>I have a copy of Capture One Express for Fujifilm, so I thought I’d try that out, as all the negatives are, well, negative, I need to invert them and crop them at a minimum before I have useable images. C1ex seems a little buggy as it would crash when I’d try and customise the menu bars but I soon found my groove with it. Probably all photo editors can do it, but copying and pasting settings, and everything having a keyboard shortcut made editing (once I got the hang of it), very quick. I probably spent 20 minutes on the first two images, and then 10 on the other 26. (I seem to only have 28 from my 36 roll 😕)</p>

<figcaption>Flip the curve</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>There are loads of film conversion tools out there and it’s overwhelming. Either as standalone things or plugins to various programs - typically Lightroom, or Photoshop. Negative Lab Pro seems to be the most common/popular one, it’s for LrC, but given all my heartache with Lightroom, I’ve not tried it yet. I think these plugins are probably most useful for colour negatives. Black and white is fairly easy. The common method of “flipping the curve”, i.e.&nbsp;move the ends of the line to the opposite of where they start, does the job. I then cropped out the blank area, and film edges, hit auto, tweaked a few things like exposure and blacks/whites and the image is good to go! Then paste the settings to the rest and crop them.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption>The final output</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I later found moving saturation all the way to zero ensured my images were black and white and didn’t have some blue tinge from the white balance setting. Usually auto was fine, but sometimes I had to use the white balance picker to find a suitable white part to get it right. I did scan all the images upside down, so next time I can fix that.</p>
<p>I’m pleased with the results, and it’s nice to have done the whole thing from exposing the photo, developing the film to scanning and processing it myself. Now that I’ve done it once, and know what I’m doing, and together with some pre-configuration of camera and setup, I think the next roll will be pretty quick to do. As long as I’ve charged the battery first!</p>

  <title>Finding a camera for my dad</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>
  <link>https://alexjj.com/posts/2022/finding-a-camera-for-my-dad/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>My dad likes photography, but he doesn’t really have a camera. He used to own one, think it was a Praktica SLR. He’s told me the story of dropping it in the sand at a beach and also of setting up a darkroom space in his bathroom, but then never getting a chance to use it before moving. Having said he likes photography, I’m not really sure how many photos he’s taken. Not the exact number, but whether it’s been a consistent thing over time. He gave the SLR to my sister - not that I think she’s used it - and I’m not sure if he has any digital camera other than his phone.</p>
<p>This is the issue though, would he want something beyond his phone? He also doesn’t have a computer, just an iPad, and I feel like photography on an iPad, whilst doable, is not that enjoyable, particularly if you’re not up for “a routine” to make it all work.</p>
<p>So why am I looking for a camera for my dad? Mostly because I think he’d like it. He likes birds and gets a lot of wildlife in his garden. He also lives in the countryside with lots of good walks. There’s lots of scope for wildlife and landscapes, although I feel like he’d want to focus on birds.</p>
<p>The most obvious choice is a digital with super zoom. Maybe APS-C to get some reach, or even MFT as I see a lot of bird photos with them on reddit. I don’t really want to spend a huge amount - I had thought about asking my sisters if they want to split it with me for his Christmas, but that probably wouldn’t add that much. This then leads to used cameras, and maybe something like a Nikon D90, and a Tameron lens. However, something exactly like a D90 ends up being a lot more expensive than you think. I think as it’s well known and then it’s quite popular and that keeps the price high.</p>
<p>Whilst I don’t want to spend too much money, I also don’t want it to be a terrible camera and then be annoying to use.</p>
<p>I’m partially tempted to get a film SLR and a long lens, mostly as it’s quite straight forward to use, the film gets developed and then there’s no digital media to deal with. Not that he couldn’t deal with it but it would simplify stuff. However, maybe I’m just projecting my enjoyment of film on to others…</p>
<p>This wasn’t a very in-depth assessment at possible options, and writing it mostly made me wonder if he really would actually like a camera or not. I’m leaning towards no and so, whilst I do enjoy a good research project, it seems like a waste of time. He’s had cameras, they have digital cameras in the house that belong to my sisters that he could’ve easily borrowed. Maybe getting one as a present would change his mindset, but I feel like he is too busy to start another hobby.</p>
<p>Perhaps the real outcome is asking him about it.</p>

<p>This, the 35mm f/1.4, just arrived today from eBay. I fitted it to my X-E4 and took a selfie in front of the mirror. It’s night time so it’s dark and I decided just to focus on the camera not my tired eyes. I can’t believe how light this lens is, even with the hood on. It’s lighter than my 50mm f/2. It’s quite long, particularly with the hood but because of its lightness it balances nicely on the X-E4. Aesthetically, the 18mm looks better on the X-E4 - like a mini-Q2!</p>

<p>I’m listing my 50 f/2 this weekend, and so I’ve justified this new lens to myself as it’ll be a swap. The 50mm is nice but a little boring and whilst I try and take it out with me, I find it’s a little too long most of the time. The 35mm, or 50mm eq., is a much more useful focal length for me. Perhaps it’s a little excessive as now I have the 18, 23, 27, and 35 primes, and they’re all so close to each other. I still think they all have a specific purpose, driven by their physical size, aperture and focal length, so I don’t think I’d sell any of them just yet.</p>
<p>35mm on APS-C used to be my go to length for years. I had a Nikon 35mm f/1.8 for my D40/7000/7200. It was perfect and I enjoyed using it a lot. When I moved to Fuji and the X100F I was at 23mm. As that was my only camera, I didn’t have a choice but I have come to like 23mm (or 35mm eq.) focal length. When I moved to the X-T2, the 23mm f/1.4 was my second prime, right after the 35mm f/2. The first lens I bought for my M2 was the 35mm. I do have a 90mm for it but again, like the Fuji 50, it’s a little too long for every day usage.</p>
<p>Back to the Fuji, and even with the extra weight and size the 23mm was my go to lens. I later sold the 35mm f/2 as I found I didn’t use it. When I was first looking for a lens for my X-T2, I did consider the 35mm f/1.4 for a long time. I ended up not picking it as everyone said it was slow autofocusing and it was more expensive. It is the older style, original lenses from Fujifilm and it does have a slower and noisier autofocus, but it’s not <em>that</em> slow.</p>

<figcaption>Long nosed Q</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The internet talks a lot about this lens, and how it has special qualities and a unique look. I don’t know about that, but portraits at 1.4 do have a little edge over f/2. I’m looking forward to capturing everyone with it and seeing if I can see that special look. I’ll probably never see it, but if I make pleasing images with it then that’ll do me.</p>
<p>Plus when I get bored of it, and realise I have too many primes within 5mm of each other, I can just sell it and probably not lose much if anything.</p>

  <title>The trade offs of a prebuilt</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>
  <link>https://alexjj.com/posts/2022/prebuilt-trade-offs/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I’m referring to used prebuilt computers, and not laptops…all of those are prebuilt. Things like HP or Dell or Lenovo desktop or server machines. I do quite like them. They offer good performance at a good price, and generally there are loads of them available. They’re typically ex-business machines and have enjoyed a comfy life in an office. They usually have good CPUs and if you’re lucky you can get decent ram and SSDs in them already. Being for businesses they tend to have great accessibility to the insides, often being designed nicely to access bays or replace parts. They often have nice hard drive bays, perfectly sized cables tucked in just right, and they often have specific power supplies that are compact, and efficient. Some of them only make 12V which makes them really efficient. Cooling is usually well thought out, and with nice ducting and rubber grommeted fans to keep vibrations low.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="hp-prodesk-400-g7-1.jpg" class="lightbox" data-glightbox="description: .lightbox-desc-1" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Compact SSF form factor"><img src="https://alexjj.com/posts/2022/prebuilt-trade-offs/hp-prodesk-400-g7-1.jpg" title="Compact SSF form factor" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Compact SSF form factor"></a></p>
<figcaption>Compact SSF form factor</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I’d say if you’re looking for a general purpose machine, either desktop or server, you can’t go wrong with some line of these machines. There are a lot of models and series over the years. Price reflects this but with some research, or just filtering by CPU you can find what you need. Modern CPUs are ridiculously powerful and will be fine for many years.</p>
<p>If you go for recent models, like 10th gen intel, then the power draw by these machines is tiny on idle, but then you still get a 8 or more threaded CPU when you do hit the gas. These machines often come in multiple sizes, from tiny chassis up to basically full size towers. Space and expansion obviously aligns with the size, but if you just need laptop innards but in a desktop then the tiny models are great. If size is a concern then the tiny or not-quite-so-tiny desktop models may be a great selling point for you. Like a NUC but without the premium price tag to go with it.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="hp-prodesk-400-g7-2.jpg" class="lightbox" data-glightbox="description: .lightbox-desc-2" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-2" title="Well organised inside"><img src="https://alexjj.com/posts/2022/prebuilt-trade-offs/hp-prodesk-400-g7-2.jpg" title="Well organised inside" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Well organised inside"></a></p>

</div>
<p>So why wouldn’t you buy one? Generally these are designed for businesses and as such graphics performance tends to be poor for gaming or ML /GPU intensive work. That’s not to say you can’t get models with GPUs or larger cases have space for them, but then the power supply tends not to be sufficient. Expansion of these machines tends to be quite limited. This is of course dependant on your perspective. As you can still get 64GB of ram and 1-3 storage devices (NVME, SSD, HDD), and a PCI-E expansion card (depending on the model). So be sure to know what you want before you buy it, as it’s not as flexible as a regular desktop. Little things like using special power supply connectors on the motherboard means you can’t put in a new PSU to enable running a bigger GPU, or some SATA slots are weirdly slow as they’re only meant for DVD drives. There aren’t extra SATA power cables for another drive, even if you could stick it somewhere. The motherboard is a weird shape or size, so you would struggle to move it into a regular case - because you wanted to expand it.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><a href="hp-prodesk-400-g7-3.jpg" class="lightbox" data-glightbox="description: .lightbox-desc-3" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-3" title="Proprietary PSU - efficient but let’s hope it doesn’t fail"><img src="https://alexjj.com/posts/2022/prebuilt-trade-offs/hp-prodesk-400-g7-3.jpg" title="Proprietary PSU - efficient but let's hope it doesn't fail" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Proprietary PSU - efficient but let’s hope it doesn’t fail"></a></p>
<figcaption>Proprietary PSU - efficient but let’s hope it doesn’t fail</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>If something fails then it might mean the whole computer is done. If you’re lucky there are parts on ebay or somewhere. This is probably just the motherboard and PSU, with PSU being the most annoying if it failed.</p>
<section id="my-experience" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-experience">My experience</h2>
<p>I’ve owned 3-4 of these over the years and they’ve all been great. Again, that price vs.&nbsp;performance is hard to beat. You get everything for the same price as maybe buying a motherboard and CPU - even used parts. I think the older ones were generally more compatible, and the newer ones have more proprietary connections and designs. However, if you research them carefully (they all have maintenance manuals online) and get what you need, I see no reason not to get one.</p>

<p>My latest one is a HP ProDesk 400 G7. It has a 10th gen intel i5, and came with an 8GB stick and a 256GB NVME. It’s the small form factor (SFF) so has a 1x and 16x PCI-e slot, and has space for 2x 2.5” drives, or 1x 3.5”. Currently it has a DVD (maybe writer) in the slot. I wanted a new server that was lower powered when on idle, and a newer intel CPU to take advantage of the Quicksync transcoding feature for plex. There are multiple G series, one for each intel gen. The price for the G7 seemed worth it to me. According to the manual it should idle at about 5W (pre-any drives I assume),</p>
<p>This is replacing a previous prebuilt of the Lenovo TS-140. I actually bought that new as there was a really good cashback offer on it, which made it a fraction of the price. Maybe even $150 or something. This came with a 4th gen i3 but I upgraded it to a Xeon 1246 v3. It has served me well, and is still perfectly fine, however, it idles at 50W and can’t do h265 natively. It does, however, have space for 4x 3.5” drives (with a bit of an adapter in the 5.25” bays).</p>
<p>I currently have 4x 4TB WD Red drives in a ZFS RAIDZ1 array, so usable storage of about 12 TB. I don’t need 12 TB, although I have used a lot. We’ve tried to tidy up but there are a lot of old movies that we had on DVD or even VHS that we’ve kept. Many don’t get watched but it’s hard to part with them. So perhaps I shouldn’t have got a machine that can only house one drive….</p>

<figcaption>Buying used has some risk 🧹</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Right now I’m thinking that I could just get one drive for the new server and have everything on that. I’ll keep my existing drives, either in the current computer or maybe look for a cheap 4 bay housing thing (tbh the current computer is probably the most sensible option other than it takes up more space) and use it as a pure NAS that turns on ~once a week for backups.</p>
<p>With the price of power going through the roof, I’ve been driven by power consumption. It does come with trade offs but I tend to find that I can easily live within constraints when they occur, and is in fact a better approach than designing for all eventualities. Although I’m still guilty of fixing things that aren’t broke!</p>

  <title>My first successful 35 mm development</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>
  <link>https://alexjj.com/posts/2022/first-successful-35mm-dev/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>After the previous attempt, where I concluded the developer had expired, I was determined to continue. First I had to purchase some new developer. I decided to go for Kodak HC-110. This appears to be a classic developer from the beginning of time and it’s high dilution ratio and long shelf life attracted me to it. Initially, I thought it was more expensive than the Ilford ilfosol 3, but that’s because I didn’t notice I was buying 1 litre of HC-110 vs.&nbsp;the 500 ml of ilfosol (the pictures are the same size on the website 😅), and even with that obvious difference the dilution means the HC-110 wins out. I also took the opportunity to get some photoflo - this helps avoid water marks. Hydrophobic solution or some such. I found water marks and drying a pain when doing 4x5. The 35mm is a lot smaller but one less thing to deal with is always nice. The HC-110 does have a lot of warning labels on it, much more so than the Ilford. Perhaps that’s just for the US market or perhaps it really is much worse for the environment? The whole development process does seem to be not great for the environment, I feel like I use a <strong>lot</strong> of water. I’m sure there’s ways to improve this and I’ll look into it more.</p>

<p>Last time I had to figure out how to open the canister without a fancy tool, and so this time I got straight in and ripped it open like a hungry bear opening a dumpster lid. However, this time it took me <em>forever</em> to get the film onto the plastic development spool. Literally 45 minutes. I was tucked into my dark bag, absolutely sweating, fiddling about trying to get it on and to take. Once it did go but then seem to get stuck half way and wouldn’t go any further. I had to then unwind it and start all over again 😢. My wife was out and I daren’t take my arms out of the dark bag whilst the film was completely exposed inside, and I was wishing I’d setup my iPad or phone next to me so I could try and get Siri to start playing a video of loading a spool. But then somehow it just worked. It wasn’t perfect, the last little bit didn’t quite seem to go on, and so I tucked it in myself. Phew…all loaded, and now I could start the actual development! Seems like not perfectly dry plastic spools can have this issue. Although does make me interested in <a href="https://analoguewonderland.co.uk/products/lab-box-the-35mm-daylight-loading-film-tank">stuff like this</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa1SGQQwNXQ">Video explainer.</a></p>
<p>I’ve made a <a href="../../../notes/film">permanent place now</a> to write my instructions so I won’t forget, but doing it in practice is quite different from reading about it. I used a tiny measuring cylinder for the HC-110, but then rinsing the developer into the larger measuring cylinder was a bit of a hassle, I might use a syringe next time. I’d made up all the stocks. I am using a stop chemical - people tell me they just use water, and probably I will in the future - but as I have it and it’s getting a bit old I might as well use it up. I’d bought some new fixer as well. The Ilford one I have as expired according to the label and so I didn’t want something else ruining it. The Adox one gives you a choice of dilution and seemingly it just means you wait longer…so why wouldn’t I go for the more dilute one?</p>
<p>The stop and the developer are both this pale yellow colour when made up, and I’d placed them in the order I’d use them on the side of the sink. I’d also put a thermometer into the developer to stir it and see what the temperature was - seems our utility is a bit colder than the rest of the house and was only at 18 °C. However, what I hadn’t noticed was that my labelled measuring cylinders were the wrong way round - I have one I’ve written ‘dev’ on and one with ‘stop’ on (also one with ‘fix’). I’d made up the solution into the wrong one! Not a super big deal but after I’d poured in the developer I noticed and then that got me doubting I knew exactly which was which! If I was really worried, I could’ve poured it out, washed a lot and then started again. However, I was fairly confident because of the thermometer…</p>
<p>Time past, agitation was applied, and then the gallons of water was washed over the film. I dipped the spool in the photoflo (that’ll last ages as 200:1 dilution! aka a drop), and then lifted it out to see what happened…</p>

<p>I was overjoyed to see the development had worked. No blank or black or something film, just lovely little 35mm frames all the way along. In my excitement I wasn’t paying attention to how I was cutting them up, and instead of strips of 6 it was all over the place with 4, 6, 8…all sorts! The photoflo seemed to work well as the water just ran right off them whilst hanging up to dry.</p>

<p>So that was yesterday, and by the time it was all done, it was time for bed! Now the next mammoth effort, which is scanning them in. I think I have everything I need, although still deciding upon what software to use. Everyone seems to love negative lab pro, and I’ve downloaded the free trial to test it out. It’s just that it’s another $100 on something. All this stuff…there are lots of free things, or just instructions for Lightroom, and the open source editors like GIMP or Darktable all do it to some degree. What I would really like to do is make a contact sheet, just so I can look at them quickly and see what’s what. I had a quick mess about with the Film Dev app on iOS and laying a couple of strips on my light box. That actually works out pretty well just to see what you have. I could do with a holder or a transparent storage sleeve to hold them in. Annoyingly I just bought some 35mm storage sleeves two days ago, but I’d just gone for ones with opaque tracing paper style back, mostly as that’s what came up first and I have them already from films done by the lab. Now I see there are just as many transparent ones, which are probably more useful to have in the long run for going back through all photos. Even more annoyingly is that they went up in price on Amazon TODAY! Only a couple of quid, but still it’s yet another thing to buy 😅. Here’s the quick shot I did, mostly pick the strips at random but I quite like the four slide montage of individuals.</p>

<p>It was quite an ordeal but makes the photos all the more enjoyable. All in all, I’m very happy with it. I’ll get to scanning them all at some point but I’m happy not to send B&amp;W away to the lab now (although I still will for colour). Am I now going to be 100% film, and blasting through multiple rolls a day…probably not, but now I won’t think quite so hard as to whether whatever we’re doing is enough to justify a roll of film.</p>

  <title>First attempt at 35mm development</title>
  <dc:creator>Alex Johnstone</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This isn’t my first attempt at film development, that was at the beginning of this year with trying out the 4x5 camera. I’ve been meaning to write about that for 9 months, maybe I’ll get to it soon… This was my first attempt at 35mm film though (black and white, obviously). Up to now I’ve just sent them away to filmdev.co.uk as they do a good job and are competitively priced. Although prices have gone up this year, so not quite as cheap as it used to be. I have thought of using them just for development and then scanning myself to save some money, but why not do the whole thing!</p>

<p>I’ve had all the stuff since last Christmas when I asked for it from family members - as no-one ever knows what to get for me. Although I don’t have a film canister opener. I did try using a bottle opener but it didn’t really work. I ended up just ripping the canister apart from the film leader gap. That worked quite well as I could hold the coiled film.</p>

<p>I don’t have a dark room, just a dark bag - as you can see - and loading the film into the spool was interesting. I was wearing some gloves to try and stop getting too much finger grease on the film but it was impossible to feel the film and the entrance to the spool. I ended up taking off one glove and then I could feel it better and feed it on to the spool. Once on, it’s easy to roll as you just turn the spool back and forth and it loads. It was surprisingly easy to do. I put it into the developing tank. The one I have can hold two spools but I thought I’d just try wrecking one film first (a good choice). I should’ve put it on the bottom of the tank and the blank on top to minimise the amount of chemicals I need, but I didn’t think about it at the time and just put it on the top to make it easier to load.</p>

<p>All ready to develop! It’s been 9 months since I last did it, and I realised I had forgotten most of what I needed to do. Some googling and I was all set. I had made some notes on what I did but I have no idea where I saved those as I couldn’t find them. I’ve since made a <a href="../../../film">cheatsheet page on this site</a> so I can find it in the future!</p>

<p>At this stage I should’ve realised something wasn’t quite right. See that dark red solution? That’s the developer. I need to find my photo of my first development efforts, but as I was pouring it I did think it looked awfully dark. However, I did nothing and carried on regardless. My sister was staying at the time and she came to see what I was up to. She walked in to me saying “1 to 9; 450 ml” as I was trying to figure out the dilution ratios. Maybe it’s me but I dislike ratios. Just make it a decimal. 🤓</p>

<p>I assume the issue was dodgy developer but perhaps there was something else too?</p>
</div></div><p>I use the Dev It app on my phone to manage the stages and times. I works pretty well and you can look up what others have used for the same film and solutions. After the developing, stopping, fixing, washing, agitating and timing, I was ready…</p>

</div>
<p>My sister looks at it and says: “is that what it’s supposed to be like?”. COMPLETELY BLANK. lolnope. We laugh a lot. 😂 Then I sighed. None of the pictures were anything special or particular, just the kids and us playing and out and about, but I was looking forward to seeing them. Well another lesson taught with brutal honesty by film</p>
<p>Side story:</p>
<p>At university, I did natural sciences in the first year and one of those was physics. We had labs each week and at some stage we were doing optics, and the lab involved taking photos with a film camera. This was back when I had no idea about anything and just used a point and shoot the whole time. Anyway, I spent 3 hours doing the lab. Setting up things to photograph, changing the distance and aperture etc. I took the whole roll and went into the darkroom. Thinking about it now it seems wild we were just left to get on with the film development with just a piece of paper to explain. After all of that I take out my film and it looks remarkably like the blank one above. Turns out I hadn’t loaded it properly and it never wound on. 😢 The moment I took out this film I was reminded of that lab, one afternoon nearly 20 years ago. This time I know the film wound on, as the M2 has the rewind knob with the two red dots that turn and I reached the end as I couldn’t advance the film.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="first-35mm-dev-5.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-5" data-glightbox="description: .lightbox-desc-5" title="Compared to a properly developed roll of HP5+"><img src="https://alexjj.com/posts/2022/first-35mm-film-development/first-35mm-dev-5.jpg" title="Compared to a properly developed roll of HP5+" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Compared to a properly developed roll of HP5+"></a></p>
<figcaption>Compared to a properly developed roll of HP5+</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As part of my investigation into why, I got out another roll of HP5 that had been developed. I noticed the leader was perfectly black and the edges have some darkness on it. My film was perfectly clear the whole way. So that can’t be right as the leader had also been expose to the daylight. This suggested chemicals was the problem not the camera or loading etc. I get on the signal chat and ask my film development <a href="https://baty.net/">support team</a>. Dodgy developer was the main suspect.</p>
<p>I then take a look at the bottle of developer:</p>

<p><a href="first-35mm-dev-6.jpg" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-6" data-glightbox="description: .lightbox-desc-6" title="Read the instructions"><img src="https://alexjj.com/posts/2022/first-35mm-film-development/first-35mm-dev-6.jpg" title="Read the instructions" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Read the instructions"></a></p>
<figcaption>Read the instructions</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This bottle was opened New Year’s Day 2022. Further forum reading suggests darkening is another symptom, particularly bad if it looks like strong tea.</p>
<p>Now strong tea is something I can recognise.</p>
<p>I’ve ordered some new chemical. Going with Kodak HC-110 this time. It keeps longer and is more economical per roll too, so that’s a bonus. I need to take some pictures and then give it another go. Hopefully third time’s the charm. Then I can enjoy the other eight rolls of HP5+ I’ve got waiting.</p>

  <title>Visiting the London Leica Store</title>

</div>
<p>A few weeks ago I was passing through London and thought I’d take the opportunity to visit the flagship Leica store of the UK - London Mayfair. If you’ve played Monopoly, you’ll know this is the expensive part of town!</p>
<p>It was quite the store. Display cabinets with all the cameras and lenses - M, SL, Q. There was a gallery and various display cabinets. I could’ve spent hours there, but unfortunately I only had about 20 minutes between trains.</p>
<p>I wanted to try out the M10, and I asked the white T-shirt’d hipster looking attendant if they had any I could try out. They only had a display M10-R as supposedly everything else was back at Wetzlar being looked over. I tried it with the 35mm summilux that was attached to it when he brought it out and then with the 90mm tele-elmarit I had with me. It felt exactly like holding the M2, it was unreal. The viewfinder was so bright and clear. It was lovely, and at that moment I was convinced I needed to get one.</p>
<p>But when I got home, and looked at the prices, that certainty started to dissolve.</p>

  <title>Seeing the Queen’s cortège</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The Queen is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-62862148">travelling</a> from Balmoral Castle to Edinburgh, and goes along the main road that’s a 10 minute walk from our house. Couldn’t really be easier to go.</p>

<p>There were, unsurprisingly, a lot of people. There were also a lot of police stationed every 100 metres or so just to keep people on the pavements. The road wasn’t closed the whole time, and so people were still trying to drive around but it would’ve been a nightmare.</p>

<p>We could see the TV helicopter in the air and used that to guess when they were getting near. A whole procession of police bikes, vans, and cars all came by first. Then the Queen, and then the Royal Bentley with the Princess Royal and her husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence. They weren’t going that slowly at our section and it was over in a flash. If you’d turned away you’d have missed it! A huge number of Range Rovers and other vehicles, police, ambulance and others all followed.</p>
