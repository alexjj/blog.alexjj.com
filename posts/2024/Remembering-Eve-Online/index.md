## Background

The other day I was on YouTube and I came across the Zero Punctuation review of Baulder's Gate 3. I've not seen a ZP review in years and years and was surprised he was still doing them, and also surprised why he's disappeared from my YouTube feed for so long. I watched it as I like the style and was curious about BG3. I don't think BG3 is a game for me, I like the idea of it but when I play games like it, such as Divinity Original Sin 2, I realise that I don't actually enjoy the gameplay. I'm more of an action RPG gamer than an RPG one, or maybe a MMORPG - although I've been avoiding Diablo 4 as it gets poor reviews and is still really expensive, even with the large sales Blizzard seems to have every few months. Zero Punctuation's review confirmed what I thought, and that I shouldn't get BG3 and to save my money. I was curious what else he'd reviewed recently, and looked at the rest of his videos. This is where I saw a 45 minute Eve Online documentary with CCP. I talked about the game from the very beginning and how it was put together and how it changed over the years, from a technical and player basis. There was a lot of nostalgia and interesting information in there for me.

It was the inspiration for writing this post.

## The Beginning

I wasn't quite there at the beginning of Eve, [this reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/18dntk8/any_idea_who_is_the_oldest_active_character_in_eve/) thread is interesting of those who were and still play today. I started in 2004, 7th July, 2004 at 18:07 to be exact. That's my first character creation date, although I think I made one before that and then we started again on that day. My friend had found the same and suggested I played. I was home from uni for the summer and he'd stayed at home to work for a year, which I think he was glad to be done with as it was quiet a lot of the time. I don't really remember what we did but I do remember we had no idea what we were doing. The game was very early in those days and there was nothing to help you get started. He found a corporation to join and the next day we did. I think we played for several days before realising we should start training skills.

In the corp we joined there were two people who we spoke to the most. I don't think we did voice comms back then but I can't be sure. One was called angel151 or something like that in game and the other I don't remember. Maybe Severio or something? They tried to help us out as they'd been playing a little while longer. I think we mostly did things in the safe space and probably earnt effective 0 ISK (in game currency, which is the same as Iceland, where the developers CCP are based). I do remember one day when angel wanted to take us to null sec or low sec or somewhere dangerous so we could hunt pirates (rats, also NPCs) in the belts and earn a lot more isk. I think we did 20 jumps across systems, which took forever, and then the first rats we came across on a gate destroyed my ship. No doubt I had a terrible fitting and didn't know what to do. That put a damper on things. 

The only other thing I remember is mining lots and lots of stone whilst doing other things on the computer over the next few weeks. It probably sold for very little but at the time seemed like a lot. We played a lot over the summer but when I went back to uni all I had time for was setting skills. I think I stopped my subscription and it might've not been until the next summer that I played again. I can't remember the exact sequence of events but I eventually sold my account to angel for about £50 and bought a Mont Blanc mechanical pencil off eBay. I felt pretty good about that.

It wasn't until I'd finished university and moved to Scotland that my friend and his brother told me they'd started eve again over the Christmas holidays and I should play again. We were in temporary accommodation, having just moved to the new town, and it wasn't until we got settled in a flat that I actually made a new account.

On the 9th January 2008 at 21:57, my Eve career started again. 

After playing for some time I tried to get my old account back, the one I'd sold to angel. I think I did try contacting him in game, but it was some story about being hacked and he lost the account. I'm not sure what he did with the character, but when I looked it up it had a negative standing. I contacted CCP to reclaim my account, I still had all the original emails from signing up and credit card details so I could pass all the test but after all that they just said the account was banned. I repeatedly tried to get it back over the years but was always told the same thing. I really wanted to get it back as it had skills points and a really old birth date that showed I'd been in game a long time. It was coming up to the 5 year anniversary of the game and I wish I had my old character. What didn't help was that my friend still had (and has to this day) his original character and could fly a whole bunch of ships I couldn't as a brand new pilot. 


One time I tried again to get my old account back and CCP said they could but it was too late or it hadn't been migrated or some technical reason that I'd just missed out on by a few months. Maybe I could've never got it back and the help desk just reached that reason first. So my first character lasted until around July 2006 and then has been just another row in a database for the past 17 years.

Writing this has just made me remember another character I'd made (we'll get to why later) that I must've sold as well or given away or something but I couldn't recover it as I don't think I had the information and it seemed like the character had been transferred to someone else (a legitimate transaction in Eve) and they were still playing it. Another bitter moment of seeing a character with 3-4 years of skills lost to me.

## Basic facts about Eve

This is hard to write as there are so many facets to Eve Online, which is one of the attractions, and more and more content has been added over the years. For those who've never heard of Eve or never played it, I wanted to call out a few things that make this game unique.

::: {.callout_important}

I've not really played in over 14 years, so a lot of game mechanics will be different than when I played last.

:::

### Lose all your stuff

Losing stuff is permanent. If your ship got destroyed then much of it was permanent destroyed. A few items would drop but most likely the other person would steal them as you'd just be in an egg. If they shot your egg you'd die and return to a clone in a station. If you didn't have enough clone insurance you'd lose some of your skills too.

There was high sec, low sec and null sec. Sec referring to security level, with high being 0.5-1 and null as 0.0 and low the rest. In high sec, you were "safe", "safe" because you could still be killed but there was police who'd at least attack your attacker, but the fact that there was nowhere safe (unless you stayed in a station but then what were you doing) gives everything an edge. You'd make money, wait for skills to learn and get something new, only to lose it all? Ouch! But also a thrill...especially if you were on the dealing end.

### Learning skills happens in real time

To progress your character, and to "level up" you had to wait real time. There was no shortcuts (although now maybe there is) to learning skills on your character. You picked something to learn and in 15 minutes you came back to a new level. Each level progression duration grew more and more, and where the top level, level 5, of a skill could be a month or more!

Want to fly the latest buffed ship? Bad luck if you don't have the skills. This is one of the reasons why people end up with multiple accounts and characters, so they can focus one on something and one on another.

Nowadays there are options to get skill points faster than training, either promos or paying money, or sharing between characters. Plus the free to play tier means you can train up a new account to a certain level without having to wait.

It was a long time before you could even queue up skills to learn and as time was so precious, it was common for people to set long skills running overnight so they wouldn't lose any time, or, even more extreme, set alarms and get up at 3am to change skills. The queue was added at some stage so you could add 24 hours, and nowadays you can add an unlimited number of skills to the queue. Much more sensible.

### Multiboxing is normal

I'm sure there's a stat for this but I'm pretty sure any reasonably committed person would have a minimum of two paying accounts. Whilst you can have multiple characters per account you can only level skills on one character per account (again at least you used to maybe they let you pay more nowadays). It was pretty common to have an alt to do the chore for your main character, like hauling stuff, gathering loot, or making money from industry whilst your main was flying around and shooting things. Moving stuff about in Eve takes ages, and so you don't want your main play time just to be flying about. 

If you wanted to do industry, mining, manufacturing, etc., then these all needed completely different skills to what you'd use to fly ships to kill stuff. As time was needed for skills it made sense to have a separate character to do this stuff. The idea being it could safely make you ISK to then lose on the other account.

Once you became truly obsessed, then you needed many accounts to accomplish the huge undertakings you planned. Need six people to do an operation but don't trust anyone? Just do it yourself with six accounts! Need spies in systems all over the place, more accounts, want to fly every ship, more accounts again. 

I tried to limit myself and I think my peak was four accounts, but one was to train to sell a character to make ISK, so only really playing with three at anyone time. I was obsessed...

### Spreadsheets are essential

Spreadsheets or custom coded tools that people built! Understandable that for those in industry buying materials, mining, manufacturing, trading, etc. needed spreadsheets to figure out what to do and how to make the most ISK (or at least not lose as much). However, fitting a ship needed tools too. EFT, Eve fitting tool, was the long time champion of the theorycrafting and everyone used it to optimise their fits. I used to joke that all I wanted was a cli interface, and that would be good. Particularly when a 6 month update was mostly visual improvements. 

### Anything goes

There are game rules, usual stuff about no harassment etc., but otherwise anything goes. An Australian guy setup Eve bank where he'd give you interest and loan out ISK, just like a bank, but there was no safety net as it was just people giving ISK to other characters. Well one day he dropped a video on YouTube and walked away with billions and billions of ISK. Likely he sold it to real money vendors (who weren't allowed) for several 10,000s. CCP saw that, checked the rule book, and said fair play. 

CCP employ (or did at least) a full time economist to assess the market and understand market forces and dynamics. Probably you could find 100s of economics PhD content in Eve's market as it was entirely player driven. Accidentally sell something for 0.01 ISK, that's it gone. 

The truly sandbox nature, the single world that everyone played it, and the harsh reality of being able to lose everything whilst playing, talking and socialising with thousands of people all around the world makes Eve such a unique experience.

## Memorable moments in game

It's been a long time since I've played and much of what I've done is long forgotten. I've tried to remember some of the highlights of my time playing. My core years were 2008 to about early 2010, so just two years really, but boy did it feel like a lifetime of experience. The game doesn't share play hours (unlike World of Warcraft) but I'm sure mine would've been scary during those two years. We didn't have kids, we didn't have that much money and spent most of our free time at home, and that meant I was on Eve all evening, every evening, and then most of the weekends...easy I could do 40 hours a week...and that's excluding when I was meant to be at work! 


### Escaping low sec one tick before standings were lost

When I restarted playing in 2008, I joined the corporate my friend was in. I don't know how he found it, but they were quite a nice bunch, mix of Americans and Europeans, and so someone was always online. 

### The players

Whilst the spreadsheets and mechanics and ISK in game were exciting, what really made the game were the people who played it. Here is a list of some of the people I remember playing with, and things I remember about them. This could be true or false based upon my misunderstanding at the time or things morphing overtime as I try and remember it.

Two brothers from America, both grownups circa 40s. One with kids and the other, I can't remember or not sure, I want to say he didn't have them and maybe had a hard time in life. 

Londoner with cocky accent who always "went in with his balls or cock out". Turns out his first daughter was born almost the same time and mine and will be having a birthday soon. Although, sadly, he got divorced.

Young couple in America who were married when they were 19 (I think), he had some bad luck/situation/"friends" and got called out for having guns on campus at university and so was kicked out or left. They ended up coming to visit us in Scotland, and then when we lived in California we met them there a few times. I went to Eve Vegas with them. Since moving back to Scotland I've not spoken to them in a few years but I see them everyday on Steam and could easily just start a conversation with them one day. He did very well in tech and they're living life as they please.

## Eve Vegas 2014

We had moved to California in early 2014, and the fact that I could drive to Vegas meant this was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Eve has big events in Iceland called fanfests. I never went to one, although would've loved to, for the Eve experience but also to see Iceland. Several corps mates went and had a really good time. I kept telling myself that next time I'd go but I could never justify it and then we had kids and it became too difficult. So this opportunity to spend a couple of nights in Vegas with my old Eve friends, particularly the Americans who I'd mostly never met before, was perfect!

At this stage it was about 5 years since I'd played properly, so didn't really know what was going on in game. I'd driven down and was wandering the hotel and shops whilst I waited for the others to arrive. We met for lunch in a burger bar or somewhere and I was sat near the end and next to two people I didn't know. I introduced myself to one but he just shrugged and didn't really say his name. Someone made a joke and I laughed, he told me to "calm down", so I gave up on talking to him. Turns out he was the leader of the alliance. An alliance being a collection of corporations. He was maybe 19 or 20, and I enjoyed it when he couldn't come to the private (and free) bar on the last night because he was under 21. Everyone else was desperate to talk to him to curry favours in game or make new alliances. Other than that, I had a great time.

During the day there were talks and I got to try the new VR headset and game they were making (I don't think they ever finished it) and this was 2014 as well. We mostly just hung out and chatted, and I met some of the other corp members, who we'd end up playing lots of games together after Vegas. Which was great as since moving to America, particularly California, the time zone difference made it really hard to play games with my friends back in the UK, so now I had some others to play with.

The first evening was a pub crawl, which started really well, and then we went on the ferris wheel but it was about a 30 minute ride and by which time everyone had sobered up and were a bit bored, plus when it came back around the rest of the places on the pub crawl had closed. However, given it was Vegas there's no shortage of places to visit. We had some pizza, then set off on some mission to find a particular bar. No one could find it and I think we got pulled into one of those places you get a table with a bottle of whiskey or something but it costs $300, and was like a fine dining restaurant. After that we were on the streets of Las Vegas at 1 or 2 am and what an eye opener that was. We finished the night in the casino. I did not go near any gambling stuff as I had no idea what was going on.

The next day we had a nice trip to the Hoover Dam before returning to the event and the free private bar that evening. There we heard lots of tales from very interesting characters.



This is taken from the bio on the main character of a good person I met through Eve, and it does sum up exactly how I remember the game. 

```
Normal night in RSM sometime around 2008 probably:

- 1shot, Came up with a new isk making scheme to fund a fleet he’s theorycrafted fits for
- Adam, 4 fosters deep, barely understandable at this point, just lit another cigarette, who knows what he’s on about
- Noran, nowhere to be seen or heard, however full faith that when we start roaming/fighting he will appear at the perfect time at optimal jamming range in his falcon
- Bubu, selling a dickpick in local
- Franky, screaming commands into chat trying to wrangle us into a fleet, 40% of them being listened to
- B3n, saying things like 'excellent' and 'indeed'
- Wengole, extolling the virtues of Mumble, every 30 minutes
