## Background

The other day I was on YouTube and I came across the Zero Punctuation review of Baulder's Gate 3. I've not seen a ZP review in years and years and was surprised he was still doing them, and also surprised why he's disappeared from my YouTube feed for so long. I watched it as I like the style and was curious about BG3. I don't think BG3 is a game for me, I like the idea of it but when I play games like it, such as Divinity Original Sin 2, I realise that I don't actually enjoy the gameplay. I'm more of an action RPG gamer than an RPG one, or maybe a MMORPG - although I've been avoiding Diablo 4 as it gets poor reviews and is still really expensive, even with the large sales Blizzard seems to have every few months. Zero Punctuation's review confirmed what I thought, and that I shouldn't get BG3 and to save my money. I was curious what else he'd reviewed recently, and looked at the rest of his videos. This is where I saw a 45 minute Eve Online documentary with CCP. I talked about the game from the very beginning and how it was put together and how it changed over the years, from a technical and player basis. There was a lot of nostalgia and interesting information in there for me.

It was the inspiration for writing this post.

## The Beginning

I wasn't quite there at the beginning of Eve, [this reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/18dntk8/any_idea_who_is_the_oldest_active_character_in_eve/) thread is interesting of those who were and still play today.

## Basic facts about Eve

This is hard to write as there are so many facets to Eve Online, which is one of the attractions, and more and more content has been added over the years. For those who've never heard of Eve or never played it, I wanted to call out a few things that make this game unique.

I've not really played in over 14 years, so a lot of game mechanics will be different than when I played last.

### Lose all your stuff

Losing stuff is permanent. If your ship got destroyed then much of it was permanent destroyed. A few items would drop but most likely the other person would steal them as you'd just be in an egg. If they shot your egg you'd die and return to a clone in a station. If you didn't have enough clone insurance you'd lose some of your skills too.

There was high sec, low sec and null sec. Sec referring to security level, with high being 0.5-1 and null as 0.0 and low the rest. In high sec, you were "safe", "safe" because you could still be killed but there was police who'd at least attack your attacker, but the fact that there was nowhere safe (unless you stayed in a station but then what were you doing) gives everything an edge. You'd make money, wait for skills to learn and get something new, only to lose it all? Ouch! But also a thrill...especially if you were on the dealing end.

### Learning skills happens in real time

To progress your character, and to "level up" you had to wait real time. There was no shortcuts (although now maybe there is) to learning skills on your character. You picked something to learn and in 15 minutes you came back to a new level. Each level progression duration grew more and more, and where the top level, level 5, of a skill could be a month or more!

Want to fly the latest buffed ship? Bad luck if you don't have the skills. This is one of the reasons why people end up with multiple accounts and characters, so they can focus one on something and one on another.

### Multiboxing is normal

I'm sure there's a stat for this but I'm pretty sure any reasonably committed person would have a minimum of two paying accounts. Whilst you can have multiple characters per account you can only level skills on one character per account (again at least you used to maybe they let you pay more nowadays)

## Memorable moments in game

It's been a long time since I've played and much of what I've done is long forgotten

## The first time outside of safety

When I first started to play, I had no idea what I was doing and probably was terrible at it.

### Escaping low sec one tick before standings were lost

### Setting alarms to change skills

### The players

Whilst the spreadsheets and mechanics and ISK in game were exciting, what really made the game were the people who played it. Here is a list of some of the people I remember playing with, and things I remember about them. This could be true or false based upon my misunderstanding at the time or things morphing overtime as I try and remember it.

Two brothers from America, both grownups circa 40s. One with kids and the other, I can't remember or not sure, I want to say he didn't have them and maybe had a hard time in life. Thi

Londoner with cocky accent who always "went in with his balls or cock out". Turns out his first daughter was born almost the same time and mine and will be having a birthday soon. Although, sadly, he got divorced.

Young couple in America who were married when they were 19 (I think), he had some bad luck/situation/"friends" and got called out for having guns on campus at university and so was kicked out or left. They ended up coming to visit us in Scotland, and then when we lived in California we met them there a few times. I went to Eve Vegas with them. Since moving back to Scotland I've not spoken to them in a few years but I see them everyday on Steam and could easily just start a conversation with them one day. He did very well in tech and they're living life as they please.

## Eve Vegas 2014

Thoughts:

- angel151 or something like that
- sold my account to him, not sure what he did with the character, but it became negative standing and then when I tried to reclaim it, I was told it was banned.
- Tried multiple times over the years to reclaim my old character and always told the same thing, and then one time I tried they said they could but it was too late or it hadn't been migrated or some technical reason that I'd just missed out on by a few months. Maybe I could've never got it back and the help desk just reached that reason first.
- Bought a character with real money for science work, Dr. Takiyoma, who had good skills

Normal night in RSM sometime around 2008 probably:

- 1shot, Came up with a new isk making scheme to fund a fleet he’s theorycrafted fits for
- Adam, 4 fosters deep, barely understandable at this point, just lit another cigarette, who knows what he’s on about
- Noran, nowhere to be seen or heard, however full faith that when we start roaming/fighting he will appear at the perfect time at optimal jamming range in his falcon
- Bubu, selling a dickpick in local
- Franky, screaming commands into chat trying to wrangle us into a fleet, 40% of them being listened to
- B3n, saying things like 'excellent' and 'indeed'
- Wengole, extolling the virtues of Mumble, every 30 minutes
