Itâ€™s been a long time since I last built a new keyboard. I think it was Christmas time 2018 when I bought the [Iris keyboard](https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard) as the store had a sale on. Funnily enough that was a split keyboard. I keep meaning to write up a post about all my mechanical keyboards  (thereâ€™s been quite a few over the past nine years) and Iâ€™d enjoy going  back and remembering what I had.

Mostly what happens is I buy a  new kit or PCB thinking itâ€™ll be the end game (after much research),  build it, configure the layout, generally mess about, and then stop  using it. After a few months I end up selling it online, probably to  fund the next one. Building is a fun part of it, so perhaps nothing  wrong with this cycle. Will this next one be any different, or have I  just been distracted by film photography and other things the past 3-4  years?

## The Ferris Sweep

Thatâ€™s the name of the [new keyboard](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) Iâ€™m going to build. A friend sent me a video of it a while ago and I decided I absolutely needed it. Itâ€™s a derivative of the [Ferris keyboard](https://github.com/pierrechevalier83/ferris), but instead of various individual components on the board, it makes use of a microcontroller. This means itâ€™s a lot easier to build and  microcontrollers are pretty common across mechanical keyboards. There  might be some other changes too but I didnâ€™t spend much time looking at  the Ferris.

The final parts just arrived and so Iâ€™ve yet to build  it, the featured image is one like what Iâ€™m going to build but I went  with blue PCB and white keycaps. It was pretty easy to source, the  Github repo has a .gerber file which you can upload to a [PCB manufacturerâ€™s website](https://jlcpcb.com/) and theyâ€™ll print them off for you (minimum of 5). Itâ€™s remarkable, and pretty cheap â€“ $20 for 5, and then $15 for postage and taxes.  Unfortunately thatâ€™s where the cheapness ends. Now this is by no means  an expensive keyboard on the scale of mechanical keyboards, but itâ€™s not nothing. The rest of the parts â€“ controllers, switches, caps, etc. â€“  soon add up and whilst there are a lot of stores that sell these parts,  not all of them have everything you need â€“ least not ones in the UK. I  ended up ordering everything else from [splitkbd.com](https://splitkb.com/). This store is based in EU and does have excellent stock â€“ just itâ€™s a â‚¬25 postage, so make sure you have everything you need!

I went with [Sweepv2.2](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep/tree/main/Sweepv2.2) and pink Kailh choc keys, these are the lightest pressure ones. The next thing will be to solder it all together, [flash the controller](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/) and get typing! Well, try typing. Making a new layout will be the  longest part, likely involving many iterations if I truely want to stick to it.

Will I stick with it? You never know! ðŸ˜…

### Update 31st July 2022

I build it, flashed the stock firmware and tested it out. All but one key works. Probably need to check the solder. However, that's as far as I  took it from back in May. It's sat on my desk reminding me that I wasted money on it. I have just sold one of the spare PCBs on ebay, so that  gets a little money back. I've forgotten how much I did spend, maybe  about Â£90 in total.
