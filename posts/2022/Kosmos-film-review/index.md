I was going to call this a review but it's not that official. Kosmo Foto Mono is a 100-ISO panchromatic black-and-white film. I think I bought it as I liked the box design more than any meticulous research that I undertook. I think it's made by Fomapan, but I think it's quite different to the Fomapan line. They suggest you can pull it to 50 and push it to 400, which I think is unusal for a panchromatic film. I've not pushed it myself, and I shot it at the box 100 speed.

As I said, I bought it mostly on a whim, I think I was just picking a random selection of things to try out. It might've been on sale too. I took it with me in the M2 when we went out to Drum Castle - a historic family castle with woods and walled gardens to explore. Being ISO 100, it's always a bit of a risk here in Scotland. A sunny day can quickly turn cloudy and then all of a sudden f/4 is starting to be a push, and then going into the woods means I'm down to f/1.4-2.8. However, I managed to get quite a few nice shots of the kids playing. I didn't really study the photos too much, as I tend to get multiple films developed at once there's more to look at.

What caused me to go back and really look at them was that numerous people commented on how much they liked the photo above. My wife had used it in our family calendar for this year and so when it came to that month, everyone commented on it.

It's not a single thing that makes up a photo, but a combination of everything. I do think this particular B&W film stock looks good and compliments the scenes.

It's a bit of a niche stock and probably not all that available but if you do come across a roll, I'd suggest giving it a try. I think if you can shoot it at ISO 50, the internet tells me your results will be even better! ðŸŒž
